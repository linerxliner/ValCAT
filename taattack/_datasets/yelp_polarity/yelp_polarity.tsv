0	This school is disgusting, I had to remove my children from this school as they were constantly sick and missing more days than they were there. The positive responses are from staff members by the way.....
0	Very modern design. Play area is great for older kids, very dirty though. Bathroom was filthy...urine on each toilet and the floor. No toilet paper. It was very crowded at 4pm.  Service was good and food fresh.
0	very disappointed,  went in early in the morning just wanting to sit and in joy a coffee. the coffee was only warm and not all that good. there is no comfortable relaxing place to sit. music was way to loud for that early in the day. i left without drinking my coffee.
1	I drove by this place last week, and it looked inviting, so I swung by today. Overall it was delicious. You know when people say meat "falls off the bone"? The meat on the ribs here literally fell off the bone; I had do ask for a fork as a result. The sauce was very tasty; its in a squeeze bottle and I wanted it to have been warm, rather than room temperature, but my tastebuds didn't seem to care. It was very clean, reasonably priced, and the service was friendly. I'd return by myself, and with others.
1	I saw LOVE yesterday, my first Las Vegas show. It was mind-bogglingly fantastic. I was totally swept away and mesmerized for over two hours. The sheer creativity, imagination, music, engineering, intricate choreography left me in a state of deep admiration for the entire effort. It was superb beyond words. See it before you die.
0	This place was HORRIBLE! It's extremely small I am almost sure it was a Mc Donald's  Before it was a Denny's. On a busy Sunday there is no place to wait in comfort. The AC sucks & they don't accommodate seating for large families. We waited more them 25min for them to say it will take longer to seat us cause it would be a fire hazard. Sad thing is NONE of us are over weight. They could not accommodate a seating for the baby in a high chair.
1	I've been to the original Hofbrauhaus and while definitely not the same, this place is still very enjoyable. Huge HB beers, multitudes of sausage, and their wonderful sauerkraut makes me happy. The $9,95 daily lunch specials all looked good as well. Do a Jager shot and they spank you, supposedly. Its a pretty cheap cab ride from the strip and a nice getaway from the constant slot machine clingclongbeepchingdingdings.
1	I eat from here at least once a month, and I absolutely love their Souvlaki plate. The portions are huge and the prices more than reasonable. The place itself is small and always busy, which is why I usually take my food to go. The employees are all very friendly and promote a great family atmosphere for casual dining. I would definitely recommend this place!
0	I was impressed with the variety of goods but the service was, like most things Quebec, lethargic and indifferent. Very likely due to me being English speaking. Stores like this have convinced me that internet shopping (in the USA) is the way to go. Too bad.
1	Best sushi place in Champaign.  The sushi is not excellent (unavoidable in a place like this) but is still very good and served at a reasonable price.  Great service as well.  Highly recommended.
1	Delicious food! Had the #breakfast sandwich, west coast sandwich, red velvet lollipop, and strawberry sunrise smoothie and everything was delicious. Employees are helpful and friendly too. Matter of time before lines are out the door!
0	This was our first and last time. Why is there an entry charge of $12/person??? We got our tickets on Groupon for $6/person. And why would we pay $2 for an ExtraHand cardboard box. You can't even SAMPLE other food trucks, it's just too darn expensive. We picked two FoodTrucks, cost $30. Add that to the entry fee and you can go to a sit down restaurant with no waiting line and clean bathrooms.
0	It was worth it for the groupon, I guess, but I won't be going back.  The place is small, the service was horrific, and the food was assembly lined together and wasn't even piping hot even tho it took forever to come out, the ingredients were minimal even tho they charged $1 for each add on, and the flavor wasn't anything impressive!  The place up on Warm Springs is a 5 star joint compared to this place.
1	The portions are enormous! It was a bit of a wait before we could be seated, but it was worth the wait! The food was delicious and far beyond your normal restaurant selections. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.   It's a little pricey, but no more than a night at Outback Steakhouse.
0	I was pretty disappointed in the size of this location. It's super small and had a really small selection compared to other BevMo locations I have visited. It's a shame because the staff wes super friendly and helpful. I may come back just because this is closer to my house then Total Wine, but only if I want something very common.
0	Disappointed! Received a Christmas gift that was the wrong size, unable to find something I care for to replace it. The customer service reps were very helpful, but follow you through the store. I felt a little pressured to purchase which made me uncomfortable. In the end I could not find anything I liked and was only able to get a store credit. Since the stock is depleted from Christmas I hope I can back to find something later to use the credit. I will not purchase from them in the future.
1	We've been stopping here ever since they opened. We love this place and since it's a short walk from home, it's a winner to us! The food is awesome, service is so-so at times, but hey, it's a PUB!  Stop in on the weekends and listen to some great live music.. a must for St Patty's Day! Don't forget to try the new $1.00 street tacos.. the steak are my favorite..mmmm yum :)
1	Greatest thing about this place is that it's indoors. We get shaved ice often now that it's hot and the best thing is being able to order and enjoy while seated in an air conditioned building. Lots of options and flavors. The smoothie I got was really good. My girl liked the color changing spoons so we will be back sooner than later.
0	First question, how can you have so many employees and have a huge store but be so slow? Second, the drive thru line makes it impossible for anyone to park and get out of their parking spot. This Starbucks was poorly designed and I have had better experiences at other stores.
1	This place is awesome..Locals told us about this place a few years ago and we always make it a stopping point whenever we go to Vegas(like in 3 hours:-)..They even have video poker if you want to gamble..The buffet on Sat/Sun morning is awesome..If you like/love Mexican food, you definitely want to stop here...Very easy to find....Pete
1	My bf and I LOVE this place!! Our fave is the house sirloin!!! It's sooo good it melts in your mouth goodness!! Oh and the lobster bisque is yummmyy too!
0	I have been going here for years. LOVE the food.  Problem; on our order made this week (delivery pizza & wings) our entire family AND extended family got food poisoning. (there is no way it was a bug, only people affected were those who ate chicken wings)
1	They have really really stepped up their beer taps.  They had 27, mostly regional seasonals.  Great Oktoberfests!   As always, the bbq was great.  and the mac and cheese...so insanely yummy.
0	Really cool lights at the fair tonight look to the north and see such a delight. Well last night was the last day of the fair is closed it's gone now for next year but they will be the next fair in the spring.
0	Pricey, highly forgettable pizza. There was nothing unique or special about this pizza -- not its bland sauce, dry, thin crust, tasteless toppings or its overall taste. Our bartender/server was very personable and nice. Thank god there was beer. We had a large with pepperoni and mushrooms. $35 for a pizza and two beers....I'd rather grate off my nipples with a cheese grater than rush back here any time soon. I do not get the hype surrounding this place.
1	Amazing ox tail stew, this alone made my day. Great variety, comfort Chinese food, good portions, acceptable service, it's my new favorite budget go-to Chinese restaurant.
0	The last 3 trips to cold stone have left me with an overpriced, freezer burned, uneatable cup of " I am never going here again" the kids convinced me to go back times 2 and 3, but never again.
1	Nice set up in here with the bar in a horseshoe type shape in the center and tables surrounding both sides of the bar.  Great place to watch a game- plenty of flat screens... I ordered the turkey club which had a weird name that I can't recall.  It was excellent- really good quality turkey and avocado on sourdough served w fries.   The drinks are STIFF!  Get a stiffy!  Haha
1	This place is fantastic. The food, the service, the location right in front of the Bellagio fountains. I cannnot reccomend it enough.
0	Seated at a booth that was tight and very uncomfortable.  The table wobbled terribly.  An easy fix that has obviously been ignored !Bean dip was bland and chips seemed a bit stale!  Ordered Chimichanga de Carnitas.  Very dry!  Had to use sour cream to give it flavor and some moisture.  Beans and rice were less than tasty .  Won't be going back !
1	Now dis is a cool place 2 chill, eat, hang out N stuff. Food is BomB interior is off da hook. Classy. Elegant. & Hip. This place is now on da must return spot every time in Vegas. Every time...
0	This place is just horrible. I'll admit the fancy and alcoholic shakes are cool but the food is just plain average - and with so much great food in Vegas I will never go here again.  We tried the quesadillas, sliders, fries and one of the recommended appetizers. Consistently blah.  Pretty disappointed since they place looks very cool. So many choices in this town, the only way this place survives is because they get so many first timers.
1	awesome gym, awesome trainers, awesome atmosphere! awesome workout!!! enough said!!!!!! try it they give out a week free!!!!! there is nothing to loose and soo much to gain!
1	This is a high end Chinese restaurant that has great service and very good food.  Be prepared to pay a premium price for rather small portions.  You might need to order 2 dishes per person if you are at all hungry.  The food is really good with high end ingredients.  The mongolian beef was spectacular....I would recommend it.
1	This is a no joke biker bar, Bubba is in the back cooking, not Bobby Flay. With that said Stick with all you can eat breakfast, tacos, or the Burgers and you'll be fine.   This is my default watering hole since it's stumbling distance from home and it's perfect. They seem to get great live bands, waitstaff is cool, and it's a 2% biker bar so they keep it drama free. Overall it's a great place to get fucked up.
0	I have been going to this place for years.  However, not in the last year.  Went there last night and the service was dreadful.  The place was very hot and dirty.  The food was similar to what you would get at Taco Bell.  The burro I had was full of dried out chicken and nothing else. The beans taste like they were from a can.  Really disappointed.
0	Pretentious place for those who like to maintain they aren't pretentious.  I thought it would be a cool low key place but the wait staff was snobby.  The place itself seems nice but it's the attitude from the employees (bartender excluded) that made it sour to me.  I'll pass on this place in favor of some of the other watering holes nearby that are more welcoming to the jeans and t-shirt crowd.
0	After grabbing a banh mi over at Mr. Sandwich, I stopped into Diamond Bakery for a sweet fix. Not wanting anything *too* sweet, I opted for a bag of coconut macaroons. $4 was a little pricey, but it was a decent sized bag with roughly a dozen in there. Unfortunately, they were dry, dry, dry. It was almost like eating styrofoam. Other stuff at their store looked good, so I'll probably be back to try something else. But for their macaroons, they get 2 stars.
1	Love this place. We recently stopped by for breakfast and will definitely be returning. We got their poached eggs and they were delish. But everything looked good so I can't wait to try some of their other offerings. It's such a charming little place and they have a cute outdoor patio for when it gets a little warmer. Also love how friendly the staff is. We will be returning soon!
0	I was leaving REI today and decided to stop in for a taco and a burrito at Taco Nazo. I am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any. This place will be on the list of "Do not Return".   The beans in my burrito were soupy and tasted burnt, and the shredded beef in the taco tasted like beef jerky. They also charge for chips and salsa. Lame.
1	After 2 weeks of research on tires, they offered me the lowest price I could find. They were fast ( I was in and out in about 20 min) and they were courteous.
1	Had an incredible lunch here. Had the American and the Brittania Burgers.   Brittania Burger was by far the winner.  Incredible taste and combo of sweet/savory.  The Maui onion rings were on par too.  Loved the chipotle mayo and cheddar ranch.  Our server was absolutely top notch.  Though it took our food a little while to get to table, she checked in, made small talk, and helped the time pass so nicely, we barely noticed.  Highly recommend this.
1	This is a gay bar which I didn't realize for the longest time. The drinks are good and cheap and it's very pretty with the big tree, centrally located and always has a big crowd.
1	This place has very good NY style pizza I grew up just outside of New York City so I like to believe I have a decent idea of what good NY style pizza is. Not to mention the lunch specials they have are pretty decent. Nice amount of seating now that they opened it up. It's also nice to see the same waitress every time we go and we only go every few months. Very friendly and inviting.
1	My daughter's boyfriend (who is from AZ) and I visited this place on Saturday afternoon, before dinner, just to get a couple of beers and check it out.  It was awesome.  The service was quick, the waitress was friendly and very nice.  Didn't stay long, but we will definitely be going back!!! Great place!!!
0	over priced for the portion... So small. For 8.99 , the sweet n sour beef lunch special I had 7 small bite size pieces.. The flavor wasn't in the meat at all. There was only one other customer sitting at the bar. Got here around two pm on a Thursday. Quick to bring the food... But I will not be returning.
1	The food was pretty good, but come armed with lots of patience, because they are very slow to fill your order. The price was right and one full star goes to the cute friendly waiter that gave us a hug, Cheers!
1	My friend and I rented bikes from Spinners On the Green.  What a great deal and easy access to the bike path.  We were set up on Comfort bikes that were in good condition - and also offered helmets and bike locks at no additional charge.  Be sure to bring along water and sunscreen.  After your ride, you can visit Duke's for food and refreshments.
0	Such a dump, the servers are unprofessional, place is dark and dirty. The tabled have the paint scratched off, I saw several people sit down and leave. I got a drink and it was awful, got an almost $20 thing of nachos that were HUGE, but was mostly chips with some beans and hidden little chunks of chicken (dark meat) and a small scoop of guac. Don't go here, walk to Paris or another place, even McDonalds would have been better.
1	i dig this place.  i love just tearing up the pizza like they do in italy.  the pizza was great...not at all greasy.  the servers are quick with the refills too.   i went there with a friend and the atmosphere seemed kind of dead though.  it's nice and clean...but i feel like they need to liven it up a bit.
1	Quite simply Packs and Dogs is a unique experience.....Hundreds of beers, and the dogs were awesome...Had the Bloodhound, wow,...The Kielbasa Bulldog is what a Pittsburgh food in tube form should taste like! Place is clean and funky welcoming. Mark who runs the place is first class ....Catch the view of the city and walk on down to Packs & Dogs tell em' the Jersey Boys sent you, special surprise awaits...Can't wait to get visit again...
1	Very solid mexican food.  I care very much about the chips and salsa they start you out with and right from that I knew it was gonna be a good place.  Their "fancy" margaritas are very good.  I got the enchiladas which were very very good.  Staff was a little slow for my taste but I won't dock anything from my rating for that as she was kinda busy.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's good!
0	I only had beers here. But I scoped out everyone's food. Lots of grilled sandwiches and burgers. I felt no need to try one.  There was a game on and the place was packed and it was hard to get noticed. There was no one outside. It was loud and the sports fans inside were already having way too good a time so we moved on next door. They had a sign outside for $3 drinks, which we had. So we spent $6 plus tip, chugged our Lite beers and ran away.
0	Awful, rude service. They told us they open at 6pm. At 6:10, the (2nd) rude bouncer said they needed a line and would open when they felt like it. We wanted to stop in on our way to a show and spend our money with them. (we have a group of 7). Too bad. Terrible service is such a turnoff. Without going into further detail, Kevin is EXTREMELY unprofessional.
0	Food is great, the tuesday promo is a deal. Forget the service tho. Came to the drive thru right before closing on a Tuesday night and it felt like I was being hurried along. I placed two seperate orders and they were all dumped in the same bag and I mean dumped. then the only excuse this drive thru boy could give me was "I didn't bag em" then promptly closed the window forgetting to give me the rest of my orders. I had to park and walk in to get them. your service sucks and I hope u guys read this!!!!
0	The employees who answer the phones as a rule say whatever is necessary to get people in the door , multiple times I've called from the parking lot with view of the front door and was told everything from no wait to not more than a couple minutes. Always a great exaggeration.
1	We met some long lost friends here last night.  Fast and efficient service.  The only issue was that music was to start at 9:00pm...we left at 10:30 and the music still had not begun.  At least we were able to chat with our friends but we were a bit disappointed as the sound check sounded great.  The fish sliders were super!  Potatoes skins needed salt.  I'd certainly go back.
1	My wife and originally visited Spamassage For You from a Amazon Local deal back in September.  We both enjoyed the  quality of the massages and friendly service of the staff and owners.  So much so that we bought a 3 massage package and then again an additional 3  massage package.  Looking forward to our next visit!
0	Meh.  I'll be short and to the point.  The service was great and the place is beautiful, but the fooood... Most of the beef (filet mignon, garlic steak, mainly) was over cooked and tough.  Only thing they didn't botch was the flank steak.  The salmon was good as well. Chicken was greasy.   Lobster bisque tasted like slurping butter. It's bad when the salad bar food is better than the meat at a steakhouse. Over priced for what you get.
0	I expected a lot from you, Bellagio. You disappointed me greatly. The only thing that redeemed you was the creme brulee.  I spent about $36 (including tips) for dinner. The steak was tough when it wasn't supposed to be. Tough steak, tough fish. Mediocre-grade sushi. Americanized rolls.  Really great waitress though!  Maybe it was that one night where you lost your touch.
1	Steve at Spotless carpet care does a fantastic job, my carpets & large sectional look as good as new and I love the smell that is in the solution, really freshens up the house! I highly recommend Spotless Carpet Care
1	We are pizza lovers and I have to say Papa Murphys is by far the best we've ever had! Our favorite are the stuffed pizzas, you won't find anything like it around!
0	Price of a Veggie Burger at Ketchup $12 Price of an Earth Burger at GR Burgr $14 Taste of Veggie Burger at Ketchup: No taste, lacked flavor despite I ordered it with mushrooms and very soggy.  Taste of Earth Burger at GR Burgr: Amazeballs! In other words, pay the extra $2 at Burgr for a burger that tastes far more better than a tasteless, soggy burger at Ketchup.
0	I love the restaurant in NYC, this one was dissapointing, not to mention we waited more than an hour to be served (sandwiches!) I then bought a T-Shirt, when I brought it home it was defective, I have tried calling the restaurant and tried to get a hold of a manager, and nothing, no one has called me back and when I try to get thru I cant!
0	Haven't event gotten my food yet the service fucking sucks I don't even know why I didn't leave and go upstairs to McDonald's they have better service than this shit hole!
0	Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?
0	If I could give this place no stars, I would. Worst manicure I've ever had. They upcharged my 13 year old sister kid sister without first alerting one of us the change in pricing. Total rip off, rude service, not even worth going back to get my nails fixed.
0	Point form: - Ordered 6 dishes. Only received 5. Charged us for 6. - Ordered water to accompany our drinks. Never saw a drop.  - Cheap decor. Random baseball cap pinned to the wall. Seems like the roof is falling apart downstairs. - Good selection of food. And the 5/6 we did receive were good. - Had to ask for the bill 3 times. As I post this, I am still waiting for the bill... Note: maybe this is better for lunch than dinner, but in general I was not impressed.
0	Two stars, mainly for really attentive service from a friendly staff. We ordered boneless honey barbecue wings, a favorite of ours for years from other Native New Yorker locations. They were barely warm, had a really unappealing texture and the sauce was almost flavorless...definitely not what we were used to and have looked forward to over the years.
0	Went here for lunch today, not the best but not the worst. I got the turkey and havarti sandwich, wasn't very good at all. I don't know what type of lettuce they use, but it was awful. I got one of their red velvet cupcakes that several people told me are "better than sprinkles"....lies! They were ok, but no where near sprinkles status. I liked the ambiance and the outdoor seating, it's a cute little place to grab a coffee, but my husband and I won't be going out of our way to go here again.
1	Nightclub review:  Love the music, love the multiple rooms, and love the people that go there to have a good time.  Staff is friendly and helpful and there to make sure you have a good time.   The place is visual overload and Grand Central Station for over-stimulation (feel free to use that in your marketing collateral).   Nice work, Marquee, you'll have us back very soon.
1	Great food highly recommend this place to lots of friends. Everyone has enjoyed it so far. I wish they were open for lunch I would eat there more often!
1	can't wait to go back - great food and friendly service.  it is also fun to watch the planes take off, but will go back for the great food at a reasonable price.
1	Their pizza and philly cheesesteak are to DIE for. Excellent food, moderate price, and good customer service. If you're looking for a little restaurant to take the family out to lunch or dinner, this is a great place to try.
1	The joy we had bringing our daughter into this world was amplified by having Dr. Wareing see us through it. I can't recommend her enough.
1	I went to a Bob Marley laser show as a 'favor' for my husband...  the lasers were really cool.  I would not recommend them if you are prone to migraines, or have a neuro disorder, such as seizures. I think if the music was more my taste, it would have been awesome.
1	Had an amazing meal! We were seated right away, however, it was a Sunday night and it was 5:30pm. I ordered the trout, it was fantastic! My friends had the meatloaf, steak and ribs. All had great reviews. The desserts were equally as fabulous! Service was great. Only complaint, it was too dark in the restaurant. I will go back!
1	Try to catch Emily's class -you will not be disappointed. She's amazing.  Gorgeous downtown studio.  Free Garage parking. Friendly staff. Great monthly deals... Update to original post just to say that Hamid and Kate are additional instructors that I would highly recommend!  Namaste:)
1	Good Guys that did Good work, were on time, efficient, funny to the point that even though they were working hourly we were hoping they'd stick around awhile longer.
1	First Class facility and staff. It's a much better value than buying a one day pass to the United Club. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was extremely quiet. If you close your eyes, you would never know you we're in an airport. The staff is extremely attentive, I almost felt like I was visiting an all inclusive resort. :)
1	I really enjoyed my stay here. The entire property is very hip and comfy. The rooms are large with cool decor. The restaurant, Cafe ZuZu, serves great food and drinks. The pool is fabu. And the spa is a the perfect spot to be pampered (even for us guys). The location is also a plus; close to downtown and the arts district. I recommend this hotel and look forward to my next stay. *The Hotel Valley Ho is a gay-friendly TAG Approved property.
0	Not my type of show... It's a sex theme with no clear direction or storyline. Funny at times, acrobatics were not the greatest. I guess i was expecting something more over-the-top for the price we paid. You can bring in outside drinks, as long as it's not glass. This theatre is small, so go ahead and buy the cheap seats. Mystere is better than Zumanity.
1	We stayed at the Vdara last weekend for a Bachelorette Party and having the Market Cafe downstairs was so convenient, especially for breakfast! Staff was nice and courteous, selection of food was plentiful and the food was tasty. A little pricey, but worth it for fresh food fast.
1	This isn't quite Luv-It, but it will do in a pinch.  :) It kind of makes me think of what it would be like if Dairy Queen and Cold Stone had a frozen custard love child...There are plenty of mix-in choices, and the frozen custard is rich and creamy.  The drive thru is very convenient, but eating it in the car before it melts can be dangerous.  I recommend taking someone along who can feed you while you drive. :)
1	We popped in here on Sunday afternoon during the Scottsdale Culinary Festival (and after several cocktails). The atmosphere here is ultra modern, WHITE, with a very open ballroom style, and a full bar. It is a "private event space" from what I know, so I'm not sure if they will ever be open as a lounge on a regular basis. Great patio, and a great sound system too.
1	The Reserve at Arrowhead is ready to help you find your new home! We have a top notch management team that care about your home needs. Stop by and say hello, we are sure you will want to make The Reserve at Arrowhead your new home.
1	Like Home Depot this is a toy store for big boys.  While they have much the same as any other hardware store, some items are different brands. The staff was very friendly making our trip very pleasent.
0	I got the pad kee mao and my noodles were a little hard and bland. My friend got pad thai style noodles with crab on top, and his noodles were delicious. Service was friendly albeit slow considering we were the only party there...
0	Crazy show i was not sure what's to expect walking in threw the door all I seen was mascot suits and cocktail servers giving away free Jell-O shots upon entry that was nice going forward into the club was crazy there were mascots everywhere celebrity look a likes and midget Kanye west it was funny different  type of party but can only be a good time if you have a table no point in standing around there's no room for that it's a small venue and they only have two small bars. Fun industry party Wensday.
0	I stayed here to view the timeshare package. They were rude and wouldn't let me view by myself. I wanted to tour but the sales staff wouldn't allow it and threaten to charge me. The security attempted to try to take me out and Andy the sales manager stated that he would call the police. I debated their policy regarding that "couples" had to view the timeshare being that I can purchase on my own.  Never staying here again.
0	Rooms were clean and reasonably priced. Location wise a C- as it is far from the strip and all of the action especially on a long weekend when Las Vegas Blvd is a parking lot and so is Highway 15. Very loud at night - with live music from the performers below echoing throughout the building through the night. Not recommended if you want to get some sleep. Not recommended for families
0	I would love to love the Willow House.  I really want to, it's downtown and local.. I just can't.  Dirty, bad coffee, rude staff, horrible art on the walls, plus I can't go here without running into a student of mine.  It all adds up to only 2 stars.  I'm sorry Willow House, I really do want to love you, I just can't.
0	Most overpriced margaritas I have ever had. And the salsa that came with the chips that I ordered tasted like it had come out of a can. The only reason they get any stars at all is because the balloon guy was pretty funny and entertaining.
1	The chicken fried chicken is great and so is the open faced turkey sandwich. They give large portions, and the ranch at the salad bar is one of the best I've tasted... I specifically come back for the open face turkey, chicken fried chicken, and ranch at the salad bar...
0	Great place to have fun & party and get drunk... Bad place to eat!!! Food was so bland & plain.. Like some bad ass Mexican bar food!
1	Beer Bar with 99 beers on tap!  I'm so there. This hotel is really beautiful.  I was very impressed.  The architecture alone is very impressive, but the overall design of the place is like WOW and I swear, all the girl cocktail waitresses have GINORMOUS boobs. Nice. I didn't stay here, but spent quite a while gambling and hitting up that beer bar.  I can't wait to come back.  This hotel blows green valley ranch out of the water (local competition). Only downside... no club.  NO CLUB?! What The Hell?!
1	They warn their food is highly addictive and they're not joking! I usually get the Teriyaki Chicken / Spicy Chicken Plate with steamed white rice and macaroni salad. I've been eating here for the past 2 years and I've never had a single time when I was disappointed with their food.
0	well i used to enjoy the food but every time my wife and i visit this restaurant it gets worse and worse and i dont want to risk how bad the next visit will be....well the main problem i had was a mexican restaurant put canned jalapenos on the nachos and had ballpark cheese......gross
0	I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.   Now you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.   But sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant. They make McDonald version of Mexican food.  I can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc.  I am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food.
1	Our server was Casey and all I have to say is WOW! She was so friendly an acomidating! She explained everything about the menu an recommended some great dishes! We had the wings, which were outstanding! We also had the Italian pasty! It was delicious! Thank you Casey for making this a night to remember! We will definitely be telling all our friends about this little jem!!!!!!
1	I've been bring my 3 dachshund girls here for the last few years and have always be happy with the results. Excellent service and skills along w the best prices I've seen. Great extended hours so you can drop them off on the way to work.  She even keeps their shampoo I bring for them. The pink crates are adorable and the owner knows her stuff! I whole heartedly recommend Pretty Paws.
0	Overpriced, even on things you can get the same of at walmart or food4less. They try to upsell you at the ice, people think its free when they ask if you would like ice, but its not. Ill start shopping here again when I am rich.
1	My friend referred me to this Company. I called them, set me up a schedule and got it done quick.  I called other companies but they charge more. I had a great deal here and the service was fast and clean. I strongly recommend this company to everyone who needs auto glass repair and replacement in Vegas.
1	Anyone who knows anything about shawarmas knows this is Montreal's finest. The food is great. The creation is amazing. These people were sent from god himself to give us Montrealers the best food ever. God bless them.
0	I was shocked to see the relatively decent reviews on Yelp as I had a pretty awful experience here. While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my fellow Yelper and will not bore you with the details. Nor will I discourage you from trying Grape Street for yourself. However, I will never consider coming back. 'Nough said.
0	The worst service period. Waited over an hour and still no food. Morons are running this place with a horrible wait staff. Will never go there again.
1	Great service. Fresh menu choices. I had salad with seared tuna avocado grapefruit and watermelon!!  My favorite ingredients for a summer salad!
1	Perihelion has done a lot in the way of bringing cutting edge out of town artists to Phoenix.  This really adds in such a positive way to the great art scene that Phoenix has.
1	Can you say nom nom? The mac and cheese nom nom is so good! Ordered that along with the ultimate cheese burger, bacon and egg sliders, pultine fries and fried pickles. Everything was good esp after a night of partying hard. Burgers med rare is aays the best choice. Moist, tender and flavorful.  We took advantage of the 3-6pm happy hour (half price apps, and $5 house wine which I got the white zinfindel yum). Pretty good place to just chill and relax. Our bartender/waiter at the bar, Daryll was awesome!
0	A diner should be able to consitently make your eggs the right way,  this place just cant seem to get it right,  ITS CALLED over medium people its not that hard.  I rather frequent Liberty east or the Big view
1	When it comes to getting Mexican in C-U, this is probably my top pick.  It's cheap, the food I've gotten has been decent (the entrees are probably marginally better at Dos, except for the enchiladas, which are amazing!)  However, I keep coming back because of the chips, which are, in a word, incredible. I also really enjoy being here.  Very bright atmosphere, and very attentive waitstaff.  Keep the chips coming, and this place is gold.
1	This isn't a Mediterranean place per se. I'm actually not really sure what it is. We'll call it a smorgasbord of lunch goodies. It's a cute place and I've been in for lunch a few times. It's not anything to write home about but  I enjoyed it. A reasonably priced place if you're looking for a quick bite.
0	They move you from chair to chair as you have services done.  They did not have enough staff and Lannie was working on two customers at the same time. When I went to wash my hands the sinks were dirty especially around the faucets. Not impressed.
1	There are a lot of wood fired pizza places that I have been to but this one sticks out to me. It's quick and you can customize it with anything you desire & its so delicious. The only thing is that the people working there aren't all that friendly. They always look pissed off. But the good food makes up for it I guess. If I saw a smile once in a while, it would be 5 stars easily:)
1	Another stay at the awesome Aria and I was even more impressed than the first time. Their customer service is top notch and every single one of my needs and wants were met. You can tell their staff has a lot of customer service training and they deliver to their guests. Amazing!
1	Fatburger is better than In-N-Out. There...i said it. There's a lot more variety on the menu, and I'm down for any place that lets you put fried egg AND bacon on a hamburger. Plus they have onion rings. And it's right on The Strip, so it's easy to get to when you're walking around.
1	As far as fast food is concerned...I'm a fan of Jack in the Box.  The burgers are always great.  Sure they're like 10 zillion calories...but that's the byproduct of tasting great.  I also love that you can get to tacos for a buck. You heard that right...a buck...and no they're not authentic...but they're a buck...and not bad at all. I'm not generally a fast food lover...but I have yet to have something I didn't like from Jack in the box.  Just ask my belly...or look at it.
0	Literally 3 cars in the whole facility and I waited about an hour for the car to be cleaned.  Decent car wash though. Speed it up guys.
1	The subs are always awesome here..today I got the hook and ladder light which is a good option if you want a lower calorie sub. On the other hand you can get the Italian sub which is full of salami and ham. Also they have a hot sauce bar that you can try a ton of different sauces which is kind of fun.
1	Table service on a Saturday night for my cousins bachelor party, couldn't have picked a better spot.  Great lighting, GREAT MUSIC, great service.  Bottles were outrageously expensive, but split among the rest of the group it was worth not standing in line and having a place to sit.
0	Everytime I go to this theater there are always noisey Mexicans that wont shut the fuck up, or that have kids talking through the entire movie, last time I almost got into a fight with someone sitting behind me cuz they couldn't control their kids! I'll stick to going to harkins
1	this place really rocks!...the food is delish...we dont mind the drive from the strip to come and enjoy some good food, drinks, and live musicos!!! the tacos al gobernador are yummy and the pulpitos are a must try! dont leave vegas without stopping by!
0	Don't stay here. Our shower in our room had mold all over the ceiling. They couldnt put me in a new room or even lower my bill.  Hotels in the area were all booked so I couldnt go anywhere else. Carpets were stained bad. Some lights worked in the room. The ac wall unit was falling apart. Worst hotel to stay at.
1	Just left this store got my I phone 5 fixed done in one hour. Had a coffee at Starbucks while I Waited right next door. Perfect service thanks cameron !!
0	There is nothing special about these hot dogs. And the price of $7 is a bit steep. Plus you get diahrrea after eating here.  And the place is kinda dirty. There is 3" of grease on the walls and ceiling and the tops of the garbage cans are full of old food and ketchup stains. What would it take to wipe the place down? Geese I hate eating in filthy restaurants.
0	We've been here several times and we were disappointed this week. Our heirloom tomatoes are soft and near rotten. The grouper had an ammonia taste to it. My grilled salmon was very bland. The best item was the dessert butter cake and whip cream. To summarize, disappointed and expensive.
0	Well prepared but watered down Thai food.  Potential is huge, but food has been "Americanized".  Sad, because authentic thai food is full of flavors dancing in your taste buds.
0	Rundown, cheap and it shows. They up sell harder and faster then a Vegas hooker.  Though the girl banging on the door across the hall at 5am cuz she couldn't get in and "had no pants" was pretty awesome but its Vegas that can happen anywhere.  Je ne vais pas rester ici encore!
0	Eh, not impressed at all.  Neither was my wife.  The menus is rather small (which, I guess you expect from a gastropub) and the range of food we ordered left a lot to be desired.  The Kobe burger was rather disgusting---I only ate half of it.  The service was great; the decor was wonderful; but the experience just didnt' do it for me. For that price, we should have gone to L'Atelier next door.
0	This place is overcrowded, dingy, and old. At least the "C" terminal is... it looks like it was built for a time when Las Vegas got far fewer visitors, because it looks thrown together, with about every chain restaurant they could find. Nothing looks local at all. Stay away from the Sammy Hagar Beach Bar & Grill. Food was subpar, pico de gallo looked about 2 weeks old, and the lime on my Corona was brown - it's pretty clear they let their food sit out.
1	Exceptional service. 5 stars all the way, waiters knew the menu and were very friendly. I highly recommend the rabbit, and lobster ravioli. The fact we had an option to order small portions (Tapas) and were able to try more then one meal (four each to be exact) was phenomenal. When visiting Vegas please stop by and try it out. Being italian and raised around good food, here and in Italy, I am very particular with my Italian food and for myself to recommend an Italian restaurant is extremely rare. A+
0	Sorry I just did not like this show. I felt like the impersonator did an excellent job imitating MJ dancing. Where was the big Las Vegas production?  There was only a guitarist, keyboardist and a drummer with no good backup singing. The performance sounded like a karaoke. Come on Rio make it a big production.
1	The best buffet in downtown. This buffet has most of the common foods you see at regular buffets. It's much cheaper than the buffets on the Strip. If you like normal buffets, this one the best bet. However, don't expect food that you see at the Bellagio and Wynn buffets.
1	Paperjoy is a lovely spot.  I wandered in right before closing time during the busiest time of year to gather the necessary items I needed to make invitations for a holiday party. Justin stopped what he was doing to offer his creative help and find the special items to make my project ... special.  This is locally owned business does great work and has friendly, wonderful service and an abundance of high quality goods. Buy your paper here!
1	The food here in this quaint little neighborhood place in Old Town Scottsdale is excellent.  Very friendly service from Clint behind the bar who is the absolute Master of the Manhattan cocktail.  If you are a Manhattan lover, just let Clint do his thing!
1	This space has been many bars over the years, but the Knuckle Down Saloon seems to really be working here.  The location is a little hard to find, but you won't find nicer barstaff anywhere.  Drinks are good, even better if you catch a happy hour!  Weekends bring regular blues bands and jam sessions, which are becoming very popular.  There's also a great karaoke show on Wednesdays, hosted by Doc. The Knuckle Down is our favorite bar for post-volleyball refreshment.
0	the front counter girl rolled her eyes  when I  asked her  what came with the combo.  that set the mood  for the rest of the" experience".  food  was mediocre  at best.  ordered the red jade  chicken,  nor sure what we ended up with. pork  rice  was horrible, machaca  was decent.  all in all,  the  place  was not worth  the $ 22.00  spent on 2  meals.
0	The Service: Okay... took the order fast. Serve the food fast. But our server never checked on us after that.... Not attentive.  The Food: SUPER OVERPRICED Chinese food. Since it is at the Palazo Hotel so it is expected. Fish porridge - Lots of rice..... only a few pieces of fish for $19!!!! So not worth it. Not much flavor too. Very disappointed.
0	You get what you pay for - no-frills basics but it works. The night staff could use some customer service training.  I have no excuse to stay here again and certainly would pursue other options if looking in the area.
1	I took a chance and stopped here to get a quick oil change.  I was pleasantly surprised. First, the entire process took less than 30 minutes from arrival.  Second, the price was excellent.  Third, you get a free car wash and fountain drinks/coffee just for purchasing an oil change. My service was done by Kerry, and I cannot recommend him enough.  He was nice, knowledgeable, and didn't find things "wrong" with my car like other places tend to.  Great experience all around!
1	Ive been here a number of times now and can safely say its one of my favorite tex mex restaurants in town. To me its Mexican with a texas kick. its not your traditional Mexican menu. I like that!  Mixed drinks are great, Ive tried a couple and im not a mixed drink kinda guy. but ill do it here. I don't know why manzettis (if that's how you spell it) didn't make it. the layout of this place is perfect in my book.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. if they tell you its good it is.
1	Great locally owned family restaurant.  GREAT Cheesesteaks and burgers with ice cream for desert.  Nice patio. Kids menu. Try the homemade chips.
1	we  happy to have it great store love their collection, if we  can have a card for discounts above certain amount will be great. great job
0	I went here to exchange a part (oil drain plug) that I purchased from another location that did not fit my car at it should. It turned out the package contained the incorrect plug (from the manufacturer). When returning the part, the guy at the counter asked the supervisor what to do with the part I was returning.... He said 'Re-sell it. We have to for inventory'. So you're going to try to sell it to someone else knowing it is wrong??? That's horrible.
0	Was a great place to eat, now food is greasy, and it doesn't taste like it used to. Used to have a more of a homemade taste, now tastes like Costco business center. Sad. I loved going here.
0	We went for a second time (found out later it was 2 weeks after the chef departed). Surf and turf roll - tasteless. Fried rock shrimp - OK Sent the dessert back, as they may have made the donut part to order, but then filled it with almost frozen yuzu crème. It's really a shame, as I like the concept and it's close to where I live... let's hope the next chef whips it back in shape.
1	Awesome place! Clean, creative, safe, great music and environment for imaginative kids to have a blast. Our little one just turned 6 and we were visiting the area. We weren't sure if this place would be fun for kids older than say 4 or 5. She had sooo much fun! Reminded me of sweet days when I was in kindergarten. This is a great play experience:) So glad we went and at a great price!
1	Big dance floor, Cirque du Soleil dancers randomly performing, decent DJ booth visuals, and spacious table areas. Not a bad combo? I went on a night with a bad girl/guy ratio though. They should fix that... but still let me and my guy friends in lol.
1	The love...compassion.....dedication....PAYMENT PLANS will never be forgotten...true animal lovers the care they providedexceeded  my expectations. I am so grateful to the warm loving hearts. The knowledge was amazing the discussion and description of everything was amazing this truly is a place to take your loved animals.got won't find better :-)!
0	Went for a quick lunch and sat at the bar. Toasted turkey Sandwich overwelming tasted like butter.  Also 2.50 for a club soda with no lime straight from the gun is a pet peeve of mine. On top of that I took three sips just to wash the butter taste from my mouth cause it was bad.  I can have a 18 dollar lunch anywhere and I think I will try somewhere else next time I'm in surprise
0	This place is HORRIBLE.  The sales person was not knowledgable at all... Seemed like he was just making stuff up.  We went in because of a 50% off sign... The salesmen refused to give us any discount even close to 50%.  When questioned, he told me I should learn how to read signs!  Well, on the way out we saw it again clearly stating 50% off.  I'd stay far away from this place.
0	Unfortunate. I really wanted to love this place. Great location and beer selection but that's it. Horribly ridiculous service. Went there yesterday with friends and was disappointed. Menu kinda sad, service worse, music selection...odd. I know they just opened, hopefully just working out the bugs. Not sure if I will even give them another try. Just not special.
1	You don't even have to get out of your car. I love the drive-thru! Krispy Kreme is known for their melt-in-your-mouth donuts. Did you know, you can order donuts decorated and in the shape of footballs? Make all your football fans happy with a dozen of these at the next gathering.  During the holidays they also decorate really festive looking donuts. They were a hit at a holiday office party.  Even if there is a line, they do a good job moving people through and on their way.
0	This is the worst place ever! The first room I checked into was infested with bugs, then they moved me to a room that obviously had not been cleaned since the prior guest left. I called to complain and they told me to use the extra blanket in the closet, since the comforter on the bed was dirty and stained. Then a few days after I checked out my credit card was charged a $300 cleaning fee, for nothing!!
0	I was anticipating a wonderful experience with The Hill Group after reading all the wonderful reviews. Unfortunately, I am looking for a home in WEST Phoenix and I was informed by The Hill Group that their firm does not work with clients looking in the Avondale/Litchfield Park area. I was very disappointed. However, I did receive a timely response to my inquiry email from Daniel Hill. The stars reflect only my disappointment.
0	5:38 pm on a Tuesday nite and the bar manager lets the Guinness keg run dry then takes 20 minutes 2 change it.  Really? In an Irish bar?  LAME!
1	I went to this show for my bachelor Party this past weekend on Saturday March 2nd. It was one of the greatest shows ever!!!! I got hypnotized, and it was HILARIOUS!! Everybody had an awesome time, my friends said they have never laughed so hard!! You have to do this while you are in Vegas!! It is a must!!
0	Very disappointed with our meal and the service. It's a new menu so there are kinks to be worked out, but it besides the beef the burger was a mess. Also, my drink was screwed up. I was willing to put up with the noise and crowd but they've really fallen off their game.
1	Brunch: banana bread french toast and southwest flannel hash.  I shared with my friend, we both practically inhaled everything. So good!! It was perfect sharing with someone, the sweet & savory combo was perfect.  There was no wait, restaurant is clean and has a nice layout. The Irish coffee and Bloody Mary were so-so, but the food definitely made up for it.  Highly recommend.
0	Where do I start? What a waste of money, TIME, and a night of our Vegas vacation. The entire show from the beginning to the end was a complete disappointment. It was way too immature and boring- even for children. I enjoy the drums but this was just a lame show that I honestly would strongly discourage anyone from going to this show.
0	We waited over 15 minutes to get our food! The place was almost empty. When I went to ask why it was taking so long they said it would be right out. The food then came out cold and not very good. The potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce. I wouldn't go back.
0	We had to wait over 30 minutes to be served a couple of burgers. No wait at the door. Then when we received order things were not cooked as requested.  Had to send back . So all told from time we sat down it rock about 50 minutes to get our order complete. Lots of choices in the area !! I think I'd look to one of them next time.
1	If you want a burger the size of your face, this is the place to go. The food is great and the menu has many different options. I highly recommend it!
1	This massage place is great! i used to go to other place but my favorite.masseus was quit so i was finding new place. Here bali massage has same price $20 AND they give coupon that if we 10 than 1 free! it is nice deal. we have favorite massus in here. Andy, Tom, Linda, Kevin Just make appointment before.  also they are starting to do hot stone on bac it is.so good
0	Sadly this place has changed for the worst. I wish I had written a review when I loved this place but now its just disappointing.
1	Order was right exactly what I asked for and did all online! I was surprised at the late hours on base normally food establishment close at 8. Only down side on line wouldn't allow me to make my order delivery. Had to drive to pick up! They also don't offer as much in there special offers as other stores in the city do.
1	Thai house 2 has been my go to place for fast inexpensive Thai food. It's less crowded than the one on Spring Mt., both are great and customer service is the only thing that's inconsistent. But overall food is always good. We've tried everything on their menu and all was good.
1	Small hole in the wall restaurant. Great prices. I ordered the Vegas Showgirl Hot Dog, it was very delicious. Average sized hot dog with lots of toppings. Friendly cashier. Will definitely come back time and time again.
1	Ive tried most of the buffet  in town, but i could say this is the best buffet i ever been too. a lot of selections of food and most of all are live action stations. i brought my family here one time and they love it! looking forward to eat here again and i wont get tired going here. Pricey but all worth it.... I definitely suggest this buffet if your visiting Vegas or you live in town..
1	Uber Fresh and Delish! I always sit at the bar and talk to the owner. If the fish isnt fresh, they dont have it. Uni is from Santa Barbara. They get toro in usually too. They are moving locations in the same plaza. M-Th they have happy hour all day
1	It's your fast food sushi joint.  A very small and intimate type of a restaurant.  It's also a bar so if you feel like you want to eat some sushi and just hang out and drink, this is your typical next door nothing else to do type of place.   They serve lunch and dinner.  I like it if I was craving for sushi and didn't want to go too far.  Plus, people are friendly and service is quick.
1	I went to the Coffee Cup before it moved, the building was old, the sevice was indifferent, but it had charm.   The new restaurant in NODA  is in a very cool space .  We went in late one Saturday, it took them forever to get to us, they were out of menu items, but we still had a good time and good food.   Maybe they are more together when they are busy.   I will go again, slow service can be overlooked sometimes.
0	pretty mediocre place.   when you go to a steak place shouldn't the steak be even close to how you ordered it.  not to mention how my wife felt after about two hours. the service was fair to good.
1	Very good chicken piccata. Portion size was right, good amount veg and cooked perfectly. Skip the Sangria - better of with beer here. Drinks not this place specialty. Bit expensive but the "light" menu is probably the way to go.
0	This place was shit. Dry meatloaf and glue for gravy and a side of plastic mash. Veggies were bland and the whole dish was a complete mess.
1	Normal Starbuck's store.  The barista was efficient, the order was taken promptly, and the wifi for my iPhone was quite convenient after being in a back country area where there was no coverage.
1	Small tiffany's but has a great selection. They were so nice. They did a quick cleaning of one of my rings and it sparkles like new again! I had to wait a few to get some service to get some earrings because most of the employees were up in the front helping people with the diamonds, where I was just buying silver
1	This is a new restaurant in the neighborhood. We were hesitant at first. However, once  our salads arrived, the taste was great and the veggies on it were generous. My daughter had chicken on her salad, the chicken was an entire grilled breast, much more than expected!!! The spicy Thai salad dressing was great. We will be going back. My only suggestion would be to have more veggie options for the build it yourself salad, like cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, etc.
1	I took my 5 year old son here and this place is awesome!! I got a vanilla iced coffee and it was delicious. I am very picky about the quality of iced coffee drinks. This passed with flying colors. I also ordered a buttermilk donut, which was like a little pound cake/slice of heaven. My son enjoyed a chocolate frosted glazed with sprinkles and orange juice. We will definitely be coming back!
0	I really wanted to try this restaurant.  Since we're eating Mexican food tomorrow I didn't want to get a full meal so I ordered some guacamole as a good indicator of how the food is. I was disappointed.  The guacamole ($2 for 4 oz) was really peppery.  Not spicy with jalapeno peppers but black peppery.   Based on the guacamole I probably won't go back for a full meal.  Too bad because the food really did smell good when I walked through the restaurant.  The employees were also very nice.
1	I own a small restaurant and recently, while out of town, I had reason to need all of my locks re-keyed and several padlocks replaced.  I called Jeff from 3000 miles away and he was at my business within a few hours.  He prformed everything I asked of him and did so in a very professional manner (according to my staff) with no disruption of business or disturbance of my guests.  When I needed to call him back for one or two minor details he responded immediately. I highly recommend Jeff's services.
0	Terrible customer service. Called ahead to make sure truck was there and when we got there they gave us a larger one that personal auto coverage won't cover. Said only A truck was guaranteed, not a specific size. Told me if I cancelled now would be a $50 charge. Will not be back with haul next door. Revised to one star. Came to return my truck. They surrounded my car so it can't get out. Called the number on the receipt they said there's nothing they can do until tomorrow. Calling police next. Insane!
0	We ordered this food for our work. All of the food tasted sickly. As in as you eat it you feel yourself getting sick. Nobody could finish the food and we all threw it away. Two of my coworkers are already in the bathroom. Very gross food.
1	I LOVE CHURCH! I heard a lot of good things about this brewery. Granted that I am not a beer drinker, i decided to check it out since the food critics on here made it seem good. I'm happy that I listened. The decor is kind of shocking because it is a church indeed w/ beer everywhere BUT once you try the food, all of that goes out the window. One word: AMAZING! Church is a place that is cool to hang out on a Weekend night w/ friends to just kick back & relax. I will definitely be a returning customer.
0	Best Chinese food in the area because I think it's the only Chinese food in the area. Hop on the metro and head to Chinatown, this place is expensive and really nothing special.
1	This is my favorite local poker room. They also have affordable tournaments on Tues/Wed nights. Their hotel rooms are comfortable, and the pit bosses will bend over backwards for you.
0	Slow service...mediocre pizza and the worst wings EVER!  We ordered for an office lunch, and were very disappointed.  Phoned in complaint and the 12 year old who answered phone,  placed us on hold three times.  They argued with us about the quality of the food.  No more for us.
0	My wife and I came here on a Sunday night and other that beer being included, it was pretty bad. The food seemed to have been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, I can honestly say nothing I had was really good. It cost us $45 for 2 people and wasn't worth it. We're locals and have tried many of the buffets but will never come back to this one.
0	This review is based solely on the fact that the four waters we received all had debris floating in them. I'm not sure if their dishwasher needs to have its filter changed or if their dish washing staff isn't doing a very good job. In any case, we left prior to making orders.
0	Old outdated rooms, my shower had luke warm water and I was told by hotel staff there was nothing they could do about it... and suggested I try running my sinks, flushing my toilet over and over and again to get hot water.... Totally inept check in out staff or system.  I waited in 4 person line for 45 minutes to get a final billing statement.   Never coming back here again.
1	Stayed here in Dec. 2005. Average rooms and good environment, although empty casino, although that didn't matter for me because I'm not 21 yet. Again, like the Rio Hotel, the hotel room I had had available AV connections in the TV so you can connect your DVD player for the kids. The buffet wasn't that good. I had better. But if it's cheap, it's a good hotel to sleep in on the LV Strip. RIP Stardust Hotel
1	Lots of fun, little bit of cash.  These games are great for getting a bit of fresh air, hanging with a few friends, drinking a(few) brews, and munching on some ballpark goodies. VERY family friendly, but still fun for those of us who don't know who the hell the Jonas Brothers are.  I personally have never been in the Duck Blind, but I hear it's over-rated. Bring sunscreen if you're on the third-base line!!!
1	I've been using Fast Plumbing for years now and couldn't be happier.  They are so good at what they do! They are fast and curteous, helpful and friendly.
1	I love the flavor combinations on all their food. Great food, conistent quality... Can be loud and busy in the evenings but great food for sure.
1	This library is great! There are rooms, and rooms filled with books, movies, and CDs! Plus any books that are available at other libraries not at the library can be requested and delivered to your local library. I actually don't read a lot but I still love this library. The only problem with this library is that is is hard to find stuff.
1	Best burger I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of burgers.  I had a Kobe Beef burger with potato chips (on the burger) and thousand island on a PERFECT bun.  Cannot wait to go back.
0	Because we own through the Marriott, this felt like a downgrade. Got food poisoning from room service and the front desk person was rude since I was trying to ask for a wake up call for an early checkout since there were so many threats in the rules and regulations if there should be a late checkout. I guess for people who have not experienced other timshares, they would love this one, but for us, we will never exchange to stay here again.
1	Love anytime fitness! I go to the one on Rainbow. Have a great personal trainer named Nate if anyone is looking for one. There is never a lot of people here so there's always machines available to use. There's tanning for $20 a month if you want to use that. Only downside of this location is no showers.
1	i got a really good trim of the beard, probably the best I have had. The prices are a tad high, but are totally worth it considering both the high quality of the work and the customer service.
0	My review is based on just a couple of Chicago style stuffed Pizzas. There's a 45-minute wait time & the pizzas you get feel like stuffed with cheese, cheese & more cheese.  We could hardly have one slice each. Some of the other dishes like thin crust pizza, pasta are good though.
1	What can I say?  All burgers are not made equal.  I have eaten at 3 of the Valley's In n Outs, Blue Diamond and Eastern, but this location makes them better, I don't know why that is.  Since moving west to Las Vegas I have discovered that I have been deprived all these years of a truly good burger at a fast food joint.  This place rocks.
1	My friend brought me here for a few drinks after eating dinner at RM Seafood.  I didn't get to go inside the lounge but I liked the vibe of the bar.  The DJs were playing great music and the giant video screens were a nice touch.  The bartenders were cool and I liked their specialty cocktails.  Overall, it was a nice spot to chill after a nice dinner!
0	Went to Otto near the gondolas and then later here. Both places we ordered the exact same pizza, margarita with extra basil. The pizza at Otto was much much better.  Grimalidi is a decent pie but just doesn't have the authentic Italian magic which Otto has. The crust was doughy and dry, the cheese tasteless and clumpy, the sauce was fine. Lastly, the ambiance at Otto is much better than Grimaldi. Prices are the same at both places, so no reason not to check out Otto
1	It was our first time there, and we will be going back! The portion sizes were good, my jumbo shrimp really were jumbo! The combo meals are perfect! They come with an entree, fried rice, a crab wonton and a spring roll. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food. We left satisfied! Also the server was super friendly and attentive!
1	This Roberto's s pretty much the same as all other Roberto's.  But, they have free hot carrots, radish, and cucumber at their salsa bar.  Yum! $2.50 will get you a bean and cheese burrito that will fill you up.  For Vegas, that is an excellent value.  If you're in the area, try it.
0	Heard great things about this place, but it was a disappointment. The decor is great, but our service was terrible. Food was brought out at different times and it took a long time to get our waters too. My lasagna was a little bland. The best thing I ordered was the house red, and even that was just okay.
0	They water down their shots...big time . I'm not talking one the rocks. They actually put water in the bottles! How cheap can you be to take my hard earned money and not give me what I paid for after a long day at work?? New management sucks period. They had a long time to make improvements but they didn't even try. Don't even come here for the burger anymore which was the only reason I came back when the new owners took over
0	Got a snack to go here. The smoothie was just ok and WAY overpriced, even for Vegas. They forgot my pretzel and banana, I didn't get them until I asked 15 minutes later. Barely got an apology. Not a big fan.
1	The veggie chili is not as good as it used to be and the parking is scary but that's only worth a one star dock.  Where this place REALLY makes up for it is the service, fantastic staff and the banana pudding.  Do NOT leave this place w/o ordering the banana pudding.  Also the menu is pretty unique overall   I didn't realize a coupon I had was for the Huntersville location but they had no problems honoring it! :)
0	I absolutely hate this gym! Always crowded. Used to be crowded between the hours 5-7pm. Now it seems like all hours of the day it's jam packed! Constantly waiting for machines and weights. Not to mention nothing is ever re-racked. Oh, the tiny bopper girls and the "swagged" out teenaged boys are the most annoying and take up a lot of the space standing in their circles around equipment. Needless to say, I will not be signing another contract.
1	Great service, friendly staff, great food and excellent atmosphere. Portions are a bit small for the price.  This will be a regular spot!!
0	I hate this location. Only here does it take more than ten minutes to get the one item I ordered. The staff are friendly, but they move at a glacial pace. If this wasn't right by my house I would never come here. I still avoid is most of the time.
0	Management needs to give these people some help. One waitress for half the room and one bartender for a full bar. Poor guy was sweating and losing customers because he couldn't handle it all.
0	The music was so blisteringly loud that there was no pretense of being able to have a conversation with my friends. We left after one song, and no drinks. When I go out to socialize, I'd rather not just text my friends across the table.
1	Great place.  The marinara sauce was excellent and the motzerella appetizer was amazing.   We went between dinner and lunch so it wasn't crowded so,the service was very good.
0	Tried this place out and was a bit disappointed.   I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was dry, even after adding sauces.  I could have just caught them on a bad day, but still. Also, I have never seen a BBQ place that does not have brisket on the menu. On the positive side, the hush puppies and mac n cheese were great. On the odd side, my daughter's kids meal was a larger portion than my Large pulled pork sandwich meal.
1	Tony's Pizza has great cheese pizza.  It is always so hot that if I don't wait a while, I will burn the top of my mouth!  Even when I know I shouldn't be eating pizza, I savor each bite because it is so good.
0	Terrible.  Workers are lazy and careless. Cathy only gives excuses for them.  Even had an issue getting my key returned when I canceled the service.
1	Perfect size brown rice broccoli bowl was sooo good.    Chicken and steak better than fast food places...   Plus the Customer service is amazing.  They member your name and bring it to your table.    PLEASE TIP THEM!!!    I'll be back
1	Clean, affordable, and friendly. What else can you ask for? After being driven out of my boyfriend's apartment by bed bugs, we needed a place to stay for the night. Although there were less expensive places to grab a room for the night, I always come to Hawthorn. The front desk is respectful and friendly (take notes, Extended Stay on University!), the beds are comfortable, and the AC is cold!! Consistency of service is rare these days, but you can find it here.
0	I love this place but very disappointed they took their best sandwich, the pizza grinder, off the menu.  I guess I won't be going here as much now.
1	Food was pretty darn good. Good portions for a good price. Inside decor and menu is adorable. Booth backs are uncomfortable if there is someone sitting behind you. It then turns into a battle to see who will end up hunched over with a back ache. Service was definitely a little lacking. We came in two hours before closing and our waitress' closing duties took precedence over our service. I would get that if we were there thirty minutes before closing, but we weren't.
0	I received a menu in my door today (in a non soliciting neighborhood) and decided to place a delivery order today. I put my order in and was given an outrageous total price. I asked why it was so expensive and she said its because I'm so far away so they charge a $5 delivery fee. I immediately cancelled my order lol. I don't understand there solicitation strategy. FYI I live in Ventana Canyon apartments.
0	Of all the Irish Pubs I've frequented in my time, McMullan's is not in the top of the list. The split-bar layout is tight, cramped, and the gaming area is like a Marlboro humidor.  I choked down a couple pints while shouting to my friends standing 18 inches away.  Once my eyes were burning from the veritable tobacco field fire, we opted to leave and find more suitable accommodations.  Luckily my nicotine high was maintained throughout the rest of the night via my clothing and skin absorption.
1	I love chipotle.  Their food is so fresh and tasty.  The only thing I dislike are the peppers ... They're always dry and taste metallic.  I just avoid them but the rest if their food is epic.
1	Great cute cafe style restaurant. The food is fresh and made on site. Excellent food and prices. We especially enjoy the Mexican style egg dishes, pancakes, and Hawaiian French toast. This cafe is family owned and operated. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous.
0	Came there today around 1 o'clock all the way from Middleton and it was closed. Hours on the web and on their store are 12-6 pm! Called them and all I got was an answering machine :( I hope this can be fixed
1	Gorgeous during the holidays. There is a massive Christmas tree in the lobby and tons of decor to match. This seems like a really old building but is extremely well kept. The staff are super friendly as most everyone is Pittsburgh seemed. I wish I could have stayed here a little longer but this was a stop on my way to new work.  A solid 6 hour drive to NY,NY from here. Worth staying at.
1	Good food, good drinks, reasonable prices. Definitely a great place to start the night! I highly recommend their gourmet burger and huge margarita! The Irish nachos are a must-try as well. The waitress we had was super cool, too. She did a great job and it was really nice of her to let my wife keep the large margarita glass as a souvenir. We were humbled and very grateful for the gift. If I ever go to Vegas again, this is definitely a place I'd go to again without question.
0	Played black jack.  I put $20 near betting spots, Double Deck, for dealer to change. He dealt right past my money.  I put the money down while he shuffling. Left that table and went to a BJ shoe game.  Deal never smiled or said a word.  Would never play BJ here again.  Got the feeling my business was not, in the least, appreciated. Wanted to play poker, but it doesn't open till 6pm
0	Pretty average sushi nothing too special. The restaurant was pretty empty on Wednesday night. We ordered multiple roles the best role what's a spicy tuna the little piece of jalapeno on top of each roll. I've had a lot better sushi at better prices but I guess this is what you can expect in Vegas. At least I can say the fish tasted fresh
1	Went to visit Mike at Johnny B's about a month ago. I had been contemplating a quick clean up at Great Clips but decided to look for a higher quality alternative. Loved my experience at Johnny B's, and have been really happy with the haircut for 5 weeks now!
1	I am pleasantly surprised; Who can beat $10 all you can eat buffet, with tasty food. I enjoyed it much. The coffee was weak, but the tea was awesome, the blueberry pancakes was not that great, but everything else was , I even enjoyed the desserts, I was pleasantly surprised for sure.  I read many of the reviews here and I am just floored at how unbelievable people are, this is a ten dollar brunch on a Sunday, what do you expect,  well I did not expect the food to be so good, but it was...
0	When I went, my male manicurist took two smoking breaks in the middle of doing my nails! And then when I went back and got the same guy, he didn't even massage my shoulders?!? WTF?! The service was just outright horrible and I will never come back here again. The only reason I went back the second time in the first place was with a friend and her mother--unexpectedly to this place. Would not recommend.
1	I've been here a number of times for lunch and dinner and have always had a fresh, interesting and tasty meal. I love 1) that their menu offers some healthier options, grilled items, healthier sauces, etc 2) that they take reservations and 3) that they are Byo. It's small and charming and has a ton more character than the walnut grill (or other similar options) down the street. It's not cheap, but you will enjoy yourself and be treated to a quality meal!
0	This is the first time Yelp reviews have let me down. I tried this new location due to the reviews and being 5 mins from my job. I opted for a manicure and shellac. Three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel. I called the salon and they asked I return and have the shellac redone. I did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling. This has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels. This was a waste of money and especially time!!
0	Maybe I was just in a bad mood and am being a bit harsh because my iPhone had *just* been stolen right before we headed here but I just was not thrilled with Firefly in the least. The sangria was okay but not great. The food was so greasy it was gross. The mini little burgers were the best thing and they weren't even all that. I felt like I needed to do a cleanse after I left..and a facial!  Too much grease...ugh I so won't be returning :(
1	Great price for what you get. Everything is clean, the rooms are a little stuffy, but running the air conditioner it helps immensely. The people and customer service are awesome!!!! We were only here a day and most of the staff knew us by name. We decided to stay for Super Bowl because not only are the rooms a great price, but the food and drink too!! 6.99 for a decent prime rib dinner, 3.00 for drinks, and 3.00 blackjack. Will definitely come back.
0	I've been here a couple of times. It's access from Gilbert Rd is super convenient. The people were especially friendly too. As far as the cupcakes? Well, I love the variety. But the times I've tried them, they were dry. Perhaps this is because my purchase was in the afternoon? Not sure. But if that's the problem, then maybe they shouldn't sell cupcakes that late, if the quality fades dry.  If I ever make it there in the morning, I'll let you know if it's a better cupcake.
1	Just one of those good ole fashion drive-in style places. Tons of history behind the establishment in a trendy area. Atmosphere was great and the deep fried pickles were bangin'. I would highly recommend a dose of The Penguin
1	Peperonata, mascarpone fritter, goat cheese appetizer was very refreshing (yummy peppers) and Red Tuna Boris Style was very good. Recommend outdoor seating when you visit - beautiful terrasse makes for great ambience! Good cocktails as well - had the Boris style mojito.
1	The food is really good and fresh -- I was surprised as I am not a veg, so this was one of my first times in a shop of this nature. I had the burritto and smoothie, both were fantastic. It's a bit overpriced, but I think they can do that -- considering the time it takes to prepare and the quality of the product. Also, as previously mentioned, time to prepare is a bit lengthy but understandable.
1	Hard to describe but hilarious and tons of fun. Liked everything about it.  Show up early and get in line if you want to get your choice of seats, seating is first come first served general admission. If you sit up front, you might become part of the show. Easily the best show we saw in Vegas, hands down. A must see
0	Bad ass is missed! I just ordered a simple coffee, but I was given an extra over watered americano. I barely tasted the coffee. I will try a latte next time cuz it smelled like the espresso is good if ordered right... we will see
1	Twice in the past year I have had a small business function catered by Nando's and I remain extremely impressed with their outstanding food and service.  DELICIOUS!!  Reasonably priced.  I will definitely order Nando's again for our next function.
0	I've eaten a lot of Lobster Rolls, but I have to say this is The Absolute Worse One Ever and they are rude to top it off.  It was dry dry dry dry omg $26 sandwich yuck
1	Bella looks FaBuLoUs after her grooming today! Friendly knowledgable owner Kelly and the groomer was great as well. good experience for Bella's first haircut. We will be back :)
1	We LOVE the AZ Science Center so much that we recently became members and plan to go often. We love the exhibits and the fact that they change out the special exhibits often. I do recommend packing a lunch as the cafe is a bit pricey, but the food is good.
1	I love this place.  Great food, attentive servers, great vibe.  I totally recommend this place! I have been here 4 times on 3 different visits to Vegas and it has been so consistently lovely I decided to write a review.  Thanks, Cracked Egg!  Oh, and the stuffed french toasts are divine.
1	Yummy...Seafood.. This place has both seafood from the west coast and east coast..  I love their selections.. Their shrimp and lobster salad looked succulent and their Cajun gumbo was to die for..   This is the real deal if you want to eat a seafood restaurant.. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I have been too in a long time... Wonderful very bright atmosphere makes you feel like your on island in the middle of the desert...hehe
0	Usually a BIG FAN, however tonight the Carne Asada Burro did not deliver; the culprit - poorly chopped Pico De Gallo.  Seriously pieces of onion larger than the biggest chunk of carne.  NO JOKE 1/4 inch cuts of onion, whole slices of Jalapeno, uncut cilantro leaves.  :(
1	What a great place.  Everyone was friendly.  The food was delicious.  Dinner for five and a child with drinks about $275.  The chef put on quite a show for us.
1	A nice breakfast joint breaking away from the usual chains I frequent, whether actually for breakfast or after leaving a bar, this place was refreshing. I got the biscuits and gravy and was actually pleased with my choice thinking it was going to be like any other B&G I've had a hundred times before. If I ever finally become a bonafide morning person I'll probably pop by a few more times to try a few other dishes.
1	This place would be a hole in the wall if it wasn't for triple d advertising to the world. Love the emerald chicken and Chinese BBQ pork plus I prefer double pork or chicken fried rice.  You can get any meat in a burrito or as a quesadilla, this is awesome.  Never miss a chance to come here. Great food.
0	This place can eat my ass!! I went to the deli to get a sandwhich.  So I asked the clerk if they used any partially hydrogenated oils. She had to call her corporate office. They called her back to tell her the verdict........................... (..........................= drumroll) Bingo!  The harmfull oil is in there wheat bread and the white bread!!! AMAZING!! I could never support a supposed health food store that uses an oil like that.  If you dont know how bad it is. peep this out bantransfat.com
1	Already LOVE the doughnuts.....but when they were out of what I wanted, and gave it to me free when it was ready, they had my heart!  Way to go on excellent customer service!!!
1	We called to make Friday night reservations for a party of 16 - they said they didn't take reservations so we decided to go anyway and drink beer until we could get seated.  To our most pleasant surprise, they pulled together some tables upstairs and we were seated right away.  Our waitperson was very patient and helpful as we all tried to decide what to eat and what beer to drink.  Service was excellent!  Food was excellent!  The beer was excellent as well - thanks Four Peaks for a wonderful evening.
1	What a wonderful evening to start out with happy hour and mike I or ( my guy ) excellent food from grilled shrimp to creme burlee fun friend, tequila ... Had a great time mike was on top of it at least we were one of few customers on the patio .
1	Good value. Friendly staff. Course is on the easier side, but I like it. Depending on your budget, this may be the most suitable option in town.  I would play again.
0	Our cheap rental is turning out to be $450 more because of the dent on the hood they insist was our responsibility.  BIG TIP: Make a representative walk around the car with you and sign off on the no dents before you take the car off the lot or you could be the next one duped.  I have never given a company a bad rating and I should have looked  here before renting at Fox since not many people had anything good to say.
0	Food was okay, average at best, service was fast and friendly and their strawberry daiquiri was yum, but the beer came out of the tap warm, never good. This place definitely needs Jon Taffer.
1	This has been the first Salvation Army I have gone to since I've moved to AZ and OMG it's great! I've been to several Goodwill's and thought that they were just ok. Once I came here I asked myself why I hadn't done it sooner. I did notice that some of their furniture was a bit pricey, but everything else was a good shopping experience.
0	Me and a bud when out to eat, he is single and wanted to go to this place.  we asked if we could sit nearest the TV with the hockey game on... ignored, After seated far and behind the hockey game screen, we waited for thirty minutes before we had to ask if we had a waiter/ waitress? after another five minutes we left, nothing was said on the way out.  Menu seemed fun, nothing really Irish, but seemed good for not hungry and testosterone filled men.
1	Our favorite sushi place in N. LV! Sushi is hands down the best tasting we've had in the area, service is outstanding and definitely a place worth revisiting. Our only gripe is the price, however until we find a better sushi place that's cheaper its a moot point.  I've only ventured here for the sushi, the hibachi grill was not recommended yet. I'll update this review once I've experienced it for myself.
0	The doctors spend barely any time with you after making you wait forever then rush you out without hearing you out. The staff is incredibly abrasive, and unhelpful.
0	I paid $16 for a haircut.  I got a $16 haircut.  No appointments, walk-in and put your name on a list.  They have not mastered the art of the scissors cut for men.  And don't expect any "eye candy".   If you don't want to pay much for a haircut and are fine with someone running a clippers through your hair, then this isn't a bad place.
1	The prices are better than some of the other boba joints around and they offer some different stuff on their menu.  I sometimes opt for the smoothies w/ boba in them and they're fruity and refreshing....kinda like old Wham! songs.  You can also opt for less sugar in your drink which is nice too!
0	The menu is really limited. The prices are literally insane. Yes, there is free house wine, but that is not free when you have to pay $25 for a plate of spaghetti. Most of the meals were in the $35 range. Not an elegant place, but the atmosphere is a rustic place steeped in history.
0	Geez that was 1.5 hours of my life I won't get back.  Well actually one 1 hour, cause I walked out... Couldn't take anymore. Dancers were great, costumes were great, but the music and show itself was just dreadful.
1	When i moved here from California I had a really hard time finding an amazing hairstylist. When I had Alisha T. Do my hair she gave me exactly what I wanted. The cut is amazing and the color is beautiful.
1	I went to Good Feet 6 years ago in Colorado Springs,CO and purchased 2 year aches supports. They lasted about three years. I do a lot of walking on concrete and was very happy the improvement they made in shoe ware and comfort. I replaced them with life time arches and after 3 years just failed. The People in the Tempe, AZ store were very helpful and replaced the $350 arches for $13 dollars.
1	Steve is as good as it gets. He installed many doors for me in many homes. I called him with need for a service call and he gave me advice on how to do it myself for free!  Honest, reliable and good at what he does.
1	First time trying Indian food, and I don't think it could have been at a better place. I got the Dhaba chicken curry, and I really enjoyed it! We also got the garlic and kashmiri naan, and both were delicious. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly. Definitely a great experience!
1	Yum. Still have not had a bad meal here. Fukumimi is still in my top 3 ramen spots! Something new on the menu is the kogashi ramen, which has thin noodles and broth has black garlic oil. Another new menu item is garlic chicken appetizer, which I will have to try next time. The appetizer I always is the kim chi!!! It's different, but I love it...it has a slight sweetness to it. Guess what? Filled up my stamp card! Free gyoza or karaage next time :)
0	The waiter was great but he just could not do it all MR IHOP  YOU had one server working the entire floor and one bus guy/ cashier  Ordered The chicken dinner mashed potatoes....oops sorry we're out of mashed potatoes!!!!   They brought me fries instead.  We asked form sugar free syrup....oops....OUT of sugar free syrup Mr IHOP  My omelet was good .....  Just want you to know how you are doing.
1	I have been going to Chapman Mazda for 2 years now. I always feel like they are knowledgeable and always know that they will take care of my car. I haven't had any problems so far and am happy with their service. I would give them 5 stars except for the wait time is sometimes pretty long.
0	the marquee sucks. drinks are waayyyyy too expensive, the security are dicks to everybody....even if you're 100% sober, they'll look for a reason to kick you out once you've paid a gajilllliiiiooonnn dollars for everything. basically, they can suck it.
1	Wow just had dinner here tonight and it was so amazing. I sat at the bar with full view of the open kitchen. Watching them prepare the food was like watching a pit crew in NASCAR. They were smooth and efficient. The food was even more amazing!! Beet Salad -  Heirloom Tomato Salad Octopus Sweet Breads Rooster Sous vide
0	If I could give -50 stars I would. Don't get me wrong the food is delish, but the service? I'm better off at the swap meet. The server Karina is extremely rude. She has 0 customer service skills. She made the biggest deal because we asked her to split a check, exclaiming "it would take too long" since she had 10 tables to serve. I had never had such a bad experience at this location. If I do come back, I will make sure our server is NOT Karina.
0	Not sure what all the excitement is about here ... just a bunch of M&M branded junk.  Walked in and walked right back out.  LOL.
1	Everything is always great service, food, and atmosphere. My only complaint is I came back from vacation and my bartender Matt is not longer here. I won't be back as often now that he is gone.
1	Someone deleted my review.. intentionally. That is very rude and disrespectful. Don't be silly guys.. I like this place and new owner is very nice and friendly. I really liked the chicken yakisoba and now they have more sushi stuffs too!! I cant wait to try them all. :) Good price and service :)
1	I went here with my cousin after a week of expensive fine dining at Mandalay Bay, and I couldn't be happier. Great ramen is heavenly, and Ramen Sora did not disappoint. I ordered the spicy ramen with shoyu broth. The broth had depth and wasn't too salty, the noodles were chewy and toothsome (perfect), the pork chashu was tender and flavorful on its own, and the spicy ground beef mixture added texture as well as a good kick to the ramen.
1	Cheap. Fast. Delicious. The banh mi was awesome. Carrots and radishes were pickled ever so tart. The bread was toasted to perfection. They also had sushi and other goodies if sandwiches aren't your thing. My only complaint is that the tapioca pudding (che) wasn't of the consistency that it's suppose to be. It was very thick and kind of fell apart. It's suppose to be smooth and creamy but the fault in dessert won't keep me from coming back for their awesome sandwiches.
1	Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.   If you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no "extra" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too.
0	I went on easter Sunday because most places were packed. One of the worst places I've been to. Their food was terrible and was just overwhelming. And we asked what the waiter thought was good, but it wasnt wat we hoped for.
1	Yum off the charts. I was moaning from their shredded beef  tacos. Some of the best I have ever had and I am surrounded by mexican joints. Prices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinks. The location near the art galleries makes for a perfect date night. It is also super charming inside and on the patio. This will be my Scottsdale go to place. Am so jealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood!
0	This place was empty came here twice. Mabe 2 groups at the most were in here. Ultra high prices Hookahs cost 20 to 30 dollars its nuts. They don't smoke that great and the guy working there was a little creepy he would pop up all over the place. The prices where just outrageous there's palace in summerlin that's way cheaper and nicer. I would npt recommend this place.
1	I went here with the group of friends. We are vegetarian and have lots of vegan options. The food was very good . For the price portions are large and worth it.
1	excellent food.  had the filet-au poivre--perfect medium rare, with excellent taste.  Paired nicely with a great bordeaux.  Terrific service!
0	Horrible customer service! The WORST i've experienced in a long time - in fact, I don't think I've EVER been treated with such disrespect. I asked a simple question about what the person ordered who was with me and the young ladies working glared and cut eyes at me - awful attitudes. My guess is the 2 girls working must be related to same because there is no way anyone with common business sense would hire such disrespectful workers with no clue about offering acceptable, good customer service.
1	This is my go to Thai food restaurant.  They have a great variety on their menu.  I personally almost always go for the curry squash but also love their pad thai and panang.  My dad always gets a different spicy dish with seafood, and he loves it too. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They are also quick.
1	My first time into a Pita Jungle in a few years, and now I'm a fan. Shwarma wrap was excellent but the garlic dip won over our whole table.
0	I was excited to find a sushi place near our home in Glendale, but the excitement faded as soon as I walked in to the place. It has a very cheap feel to it. Fake plants everywhere, bad lighting, you get the point. We sat and ordered a few different rolls...none of which were good. The fish was not very fresh and the presentation was lacking.  If you are really craving sushi and there is nothing else, this will do-but don't get your hopes up!
1	When Sofi's opened it was a refreshing change to the typical pubs in the area.  Quirky and fun with a decent selection of drinks and pleasant bar staff. The draught beers are a bit limited, but there are plenty of bottles and the swedish cider selection was unusually good before it became more commonplace. I haven't been to any of the 'nights' that they run (knitting, cinema etc), but it's great place to meet friends for a catch up.
1	Always been a favorite bar for my boyfriend & I . The vibe here is what I really look for in a bar- easy, no problems. The patio that wraps around the whole old house is really neat & really cool pond. Cold beer & oysters is what I come in for- every time great. Bartenders are really nice & chill . They are attentive & hold good polite convos.  Only think that bummers me out is I am not closer to the location !
1	great local business, servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually. this is a strange little spot but so good. everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight. one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast!! :) ive heard great things! my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu...
1	We went to see a comedy show, but we loved the place.  It has a great emphasis, helping those who have been affected by abuse.  And the service and offerings are outstanding.  I tried my hubby's smoothie...MmmMmmmm.  My green tea was great, and they have sugar in the raw, which I prefer!   A great place to see comedy or hear poetry and relax on an inexpensive date while helping others!  Win-win-WIN!
0	Hello Spirit Airline. I'm sittin' in one of your planes now in Vegas headed to Oakland. It's already 45 minutes late because of some paperwork. Is this something I can get my money back for? Or I can sue you for.  The weather is lovely so it sure looks fine to fly. This wait is ridiculous. Please respond to mclato12@yahoo.com.
0	The good was decent but the staff didn't seem very friendly here. They really like to nickel and dime you here for everything it seems like. It was clean at least. They don't really offer anything that would make me want to come back. Go down the street a block to Los Taquitos instead.
1	Second visit was with Owen. I'm not sure if bc my first blow out was free it was different but Owen is a-mazing.  I got an aromatherapy head massage at the shampoo bowl which was so relaxing.  He even helped me pick out some Frankie Rose eye shadow and lip gloss for my night out.  Ill definitely be a regular.  My next appt with Owen is in two weeks.
0	Been to this bar 3 times now and every time I have had to correct the wait staff when it came time to pay the check. They have added drinks and food that we didn't order all three times. Was there this past weekend and they added a drink we didn't order. Out side of that its a fun place in a great location. 1 star for bad service. Keep track of what you order.
1	I went to the one on Eastern in Henderson in the Gold's Gym shopping plaza.  My friend took me there and she had the Summer Ramen Dish Special which was corn, tomato sauce and was really tasty. I had the cool noodles which was zesty and light for a lunch meal.  It came with the Yuzi lemony sauce. It was good eats! This was back in 2012 or 2013.
0	Food was OK not great how ever the crab cake was terrible the worst I have ever had. The service was even worse. The staff clueless unfriendly and rushed everything. The restaurant was only a third full . Now I know why.
1	Coworkers and I go here for lunch and all I can say is amazing!  The owners are so proud of the food that they serve and are always willing to make recommendations.  As the other review said don't be fooled for the look of the place you will not be disappointed.  The last time I had this beef cooked in it's own juices and want to just keep going back for more.  We tried the churros OMG delicious!  Definitely do not just drive by this place!
1	Best value in buffet dinner at the south end of the Strip.   INCLUDES wine and beer, as well as good dessert bar.  TOM, the waiter, is the best waiter there ... Great service, ask for him.
0	It's a Friday, at midnight. The Vig Uptown has 4 stars on Yelp.....HOW COME THERE'S NO ONE HERE??? Where is everyone? Why is it so quiet? I was very confused- it looks like a place where there should be a ton of people. But no, empty. Sad.
0	The service is usually sub-par, and the food is just "okay". The prices aren't bad and they have a great location, which is the only thing that has kept my business. They usually have good beer on tap, so that's a plus.
0	I hate this place. Terrible service and dining experience. Hostess that doesn't really want to be there. Waitresses overburdened with vast real estate. Managers not paying attention and the food was subpar. Chicken pot pie was tiny and way undercooked.
0	food is nothing exceptional but charges premium price.  BBQ ribs too salty and over  cooked.  chicken is dry.  hate to compare this to KFC.
1	I was so impressed with this company from beginning to end!  I used their services to move furniture within the house from down stairs to upstairs.... Changed my mind a couple of times and they were so accommodating...  I had the "best" guys EVER!!! Eric and Coby!!  I will use them every time... Thanks guys!
1	Four stars for the fact that they don't have a cover charge! The V bar is nice inside (it sounds louder from the outside than it actually is), and on the night we were there, the dj was playing some fun and classic tunes.
1	This ain't your Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone, and that's why you come here. Drop in, ask to try their delicious ice cream, or are you feeling like a churro?  It's REALLY hot outside.  Even more the reason to park, run in, be attended to quickly, run back out with your tasty choice.  It is colorful and kids would really dig this place (ADULTS TOO) The horchata was excellente...
0	Just okay. The temperatures on our steaks were not consistent. Mine, the dry aged NY strip, was gristly and tough. Great service, but the food was not worth coming back for.  It's a quiet place, but that could be because it was pretty dead on a Saturday night. I'm a local, and I know we have lots of great places here. This isn't one of them.
1	I'm a Burmese so this restaurant is an awesome find for me. They make great Burmese food. I would have to recommend trying out the Burmese tea leaf salad or Ginger salad to first get a taste of Burmese cuisine.  Also definitely try out Burmese tea. I promise you. You won't regret that. It is true that this place is still starting out and need some improvements but the food is worth it.
0	I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because "the computer won't let us," we again got a sub-par breakfast.  So if you want to wakey, wakey, eggs & bac-y, avoid this place.  You will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food.
1	We went on a Saturday afternoon, the decor was inviting. The staff wasn't  as friendly as some places we have been. However, they were not rude or anything. Just not overly friendly.The Rolls are good sized portions and the sauces are really yummy. Food overall was great!!!!!!
1	Fantastic food and atmosphere. Service is great too and everything feels just right. Only thing is that the process differed in my case from the bill to the menu and the appetisers given were a bit stingy.
1	My family has been using Dr. Burke for our pets since I was to young to remember. He has a great personality, is very knowledgeable and is great with the pets! His prices are fair and you can usually get an appointment within a week or sooner for emergencies. The offices are always clean, bright and the front desk staff is very friendly. We have brought Dogs, Cats and Birds to Dr. Burke.
1	Their food is always excellent, no matter what I've ordered (though I must say I love the Salmon salad with jalapeno dressing and the butternut squash ravioli with truffle oil). The firepit is relaxing. The music is fun. The service is sketchy...touch and go. Don't go if you've got a timeline.
0	When we walked in we were the only ones there and the person working didn't have a  great understanding of the menu. Our food took a long time to come out and when we got it the food didn't seem to the highest quality and was overly sweet like we were eating syrup or dessert I wouldn't recommend it.
0	The service, chips and salsa were fine then it all went South.  I had the La Bandera (3 enchiladas) and all of them were tasteless and the meat was tough.  I went because I had a gift card.  As much as I love free meals I would gladly have paid double for good food.
0	Let me begin with I ordered seafood in a land locked state.  That may have been the problem from the get go.  Shrimp fried rice made me sick and my company that had the chicken didn't enjoy it either.  We threw our leftovers out.
1	Being a Francophile, my expectations were quite high for a buffet that touts a culinary regional tour of France. Highlights first! CREPE STATION is a made to order delight. My fave is the banana nutella crepe. The CASSOULET is very scrumptious along with the CHOUCROUTE. As for the desserts not really sure what those taste like. I was thoroughly stuffed. Service is great btw!!! Well worth it and I would come back again!!!
1	The bedding was AMazing!!! Tv is too slow as in every Sheraton. Too much chlorine in the pool......the service and rooms make up for it. Try staying on a private floor....the club lounge has complimentary breakfast and happy hour snacks! Worth the extra
1	Whoo hoo. Suite upgrade! The Ivory Suite was very modern and spacious. Love the pink couch in the living room. Bathroom was spacious but no tub. I did not like the glass doors. I thought I broke it several times because it always made a loud noise when I closed it. Bed room was spacey but a little empty. a master bathroom and a restroom. I really enjoyed staying off the strip and away from its madness.
1	Friendly service. Huge portions for our reasonably priced meal. No problems accommodating our party of 6. Our party had antipasta, wings, pizza & Stromboli. Everyone was happy with their meal. Would recommend.
1	People & service were great. The pastries were delicious. The coffee was too bitter for my taste otherwise I liked this place alot. I highly recommend it!
1	Delicious food! The concierge at the Ritz Carlton told us about this place. I had the hangar steak and it didn't disappoint! If you want French with generous proportions, you need to try this restaurant.
0	I get so frustrated when you get home and most of the order is incorrect or items are missing. What more do I need to say about that? The interior is surprisingly dirty/messy, especially considering the location.  The last time I dined at this location I said out loud that I can't believe the condition of this place and had I known I would make the choice to go elsewhere.
1	Fresh bread and the BEST. PEPPERONI ROLLS. EVER. This is a special treat for me and hubby, and we always take our out-of-town guests to the Strip for one of these delicious treats.
1	So much fun!! My only real complain was that our server never came to get our drinks even after I asked another lady to bring our server over. My mom kind of missed the opening because she was waiting at the bar. You also get a poster if you check in on yelp! Sadly I left mine in the hotel room by accident. But I got an amazing picture with them which is far more valuable ;)
0	The items in this store are more expensive to those of other 7-11s.  This location is attached to the Doubletree hotel so maybe that would explain higher priced merchandise.  It does seem like tourist prices.  Also they do not carry fresh bananas.
0	STAY AWAY!! If your looking for a fun and good tasting japanese place this is NOT the place. wasted so much money here. Went here expecting a nice dinner with the family and was very dissapointed! The place was empty (so hard to find in the hotel) waaayyyy over priced sushi was gross and not fresh the chicken teriaki tasted like they thawed it out from the freezer the salmon was over cooked hair in the food miso soup and tempura was ok Dont waste your time and money please!!
0	Greasy eggs, Who can screw up toast? it  tasted funny and had to be sent back!  Really bad service - no tip here! Walk around this one! It is probably a better bar!
1	I have never, in the 20 years that I've been getting pedicures, had an experience like this. I had come to accept mediocre in the past...Lish goes above and beyond in EVERY WAY! Most importantly, they took their time, and actually removed ALL the dead skin. They are super friendly, highly professional, offer you a beverage when you arrive, and do a SUPERB job! I am super excited to have a salon like this close to home, they will be seeing me regularly!!!!! (this coming from someone who never posts reviews!)
1	I love this place. along with all of my family and friends. this is our go to place. Love the music. Love the vibe. its so nicely decorated as well. the owners are awesome! love ramen tatsu!
0	They changed the menu!  My server tried to explain the items they no longer had.  When I complained and said I would come less often (i usually come twice a month) my server, Christopher R, decided to just walk away after chirping "It was changed well over a month ago". The pizza I decided to order was horrible.  Needless to say based on the change in the menu and the horrible service that I won't be going back anytime soon.
0	Open on time and have a dedicated line for your customers to call. Is that too much to ask. I go there 2 hours after the are supposed to be open and they are still closed. So I call the number listed and its some guys cell phone and he doesn't even answer with the name of the place. Just a "yeah" Not dependable with questionable service so can't recommend it.
1	I LOVE this place!! They are amazing with customer service and they do great work too. Andy himself is hilarious and everyone there is really nice and attentive. If you really wanna be pampered definitely, this is the place to go.
1	This place is awesome. What I think an old fashioned supper club would be like.  Huge bar and lots of seating.  The cheese curds are delicious and the fish fry is a must order! Good parking too.
0	It's seriously mind blowing that a company can stay in business when everyone that works there are so incompetent!!  It's way too much to write, just know that I will never in my life shop at Sears again. The most simplest task in the world cannot be complete there.
1	i have no preconceived notions (i'm ignorant) about wine but am trying to learn.  this place is very well thought out and according to my friend who knows everything about wine, has a superb collection.  nice little bar to taste and nice selection of half bottles to purchase...a bit chilly though...it really is 55 degrees in there.
0	For the price and quality. I've had better. When I go to a Mexican Restaurant, I like to try their lengua (tongue) because it's how I can tell if they put thought and effort into their cooking.  The Lengua at Roberto's is flavorless and greasy. I've had better in Los Angeles.  The positive note with Robertos is their burrito contents. They will give you a burrito filled with meat. So filling... but flavor, it's lacking.
1	This place is the BEST GELATO EVER. For 2 reasons really. 1. Every flavor is addictive and delicious.  2. The owners of this quaint little place are the sweeeeetest most adorable people I have ever met.  They were needlessly friendly and helpful. Every time I come I get their strawberry. Large of course.
0	Flew into Vegas on a Thursday and was starving when we got here. We decided to give Diablos a shot. It was relatively cheap for Vegas standards and the food was ok. The service though was below par. Really long waits, pretty much no attention from our server. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food and sort of slammed the food down and left in hurry.  I had the jalapino chicken tacos which were decent, and 1 beer. I was never asked if I wanted another...which I did.
1	I ran into this wonderful non profit at a military family event and they're amazing.  They make wooden toys and just give them away! Beautiful people!
1	We just returned home after 4 days in Vegas. 2 nites in a row we were at Level 107. We loved it. There were 7 of us. Great service, the food(appetizers) we very good and the martinis great. 2 for 1 on martinis, 50% off appetizers. I'm usually not a martini drinker, but the caramel and the raspberry were very good. Go there, you'll have great drinks, service and a nice group of friendly people working there.
1	Great food. The vegetarian options are great off the menu esp the chili naan and malai kofta. The buffet is not so great in terms of options.
1	I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.
1	Great place for all your eye care needs! From the eye exam, to explaining my insurance coverage, and placing my contact lens order, they were efficient, very friendly, and informative. I'll definitely come back! :)
1	They have the best sale and I'm usually picky with clothes, but I like how they have trendy selections here at a great price. Its another place for bargain clothes other than Kohls and they're consistently good about having sales.
1	Great Mexican fast foods restaurant,  prices are fair and servings are great. Taco Bell,  Del Taco pale in comparison.  Has regular employees that are good to us regulars. As a family we eat there atleast once a week.  Great deals on tacos and burros on Monday s and Tuesdays. Student specials too
1	This Trader Joe's location gets 5 stars from me for: *Always being clean (This is a make or break for me on whether or not I will come back to a store...yes a store!) *Rarely being out of stock of stuff (and even when they are, not for long) *Friendly and uncreepy staff *Great Prices *Close to my house (lol) One word of caution...do NOT go shopping here on a Sunday afternoon...it is PACKED and parking can be a little bit of a bear...
1	I've been here quite a few times all pre planned to see certain performers.  I must say I do like this place they book good artists it has a good feel to it.  It's not the easiest to get a drink maybe I need to be more aggressive or maybe they need to make away with the stupid under 21 division especially since the 21 under side has a better view of the stage but you can't have a drink on that side. anyway keep on booking good music and i'll keep coming
0	Absolutely horrible experience at this Hotel/Casino. The first room (non-smoking) reeked of cigarette smoke and some incredibly nasty fragrance trying to mask it. The second room had a broken bathroom sink.  The valet service was extremely slow. They took 30 to 45 minutes to bring our bags to the room. The room service food selection is pathetic. Never, never, again. I'm checking out asap, and moving to a different hotel.
1	After a poor experience at the verizon store on maryland parkway, i went to this store. They fixed me up, got me into a better plan, and were clearly on the ball.  Nice people too.
1	Fast friendly service and great ice cream. Deducted one star for price though, 2 cups of ice cream without toppings was $4 and change.
1	They have great food! Always clean in the store and you can even call ahead your order so you don't have to wait while they cook it fresh! Its not to long of a wait but at times it can be so to have this option available I love! This location is VERY hard to find though! More signs!!!!
0	The wait for a new card, not that long. The two stars is because some asshole backed into my car and took off without leaving any insurance info. Was a really nice surprise to come out to my car and see a bunch of paint missing. Conveniently there weren't any cameras that caught what happened. Oh well. Thank god I'm covered.
1	By far the hottest nightclub on the Vegas strip! Worth every dollar spent here!!  Words cannot describe how awesome this place is!  Add it to your bucket list!!
0	Went to Coconuts Fish Cafe last night for dinner.  Cute atmosphere.    The food was fair.  Two tacos for 11.00 is a bit much.   Nothing else to go with the tacos either.   The cabbage should have been sliced thinner.  It was in chunks.   The fish and chips dinner was mostly french fries.   The fish was cooked too much.  Almost to the dark brown side instead of golden.  Don't think I will be heading back there again.  I rate it a 6 out of 10.
0	Die Cocktails waren einen Besuch wert, alles andere war eher enttäuschend bei unserem Besuch. Ideal zentral und ein wenig ausgefallen (Prinz-Max-Palais) gelegen, enttäuschte vor allem die Einrichtung mit der Abwesenheit jeglicher Atmosphäre (mit Ausnahme einer sterilen Krankenhauszelle evtl.) und die mehr abwesende und gleichgültige als freundliche Bedienung.
0	Pros: Broad menu selection. Cons: Unrealistic beer prices... at least, for Guinness. At $6.50 per (imperial) pint, it's the most expensive Guinness in Charlotte.
1	Visites last night and it was superb.  Best sushi, great food and great personnel including all.  I'll come back next time I visit Montreal.
1	Great, as usual. Am glad the pricing has remained affordable. For those who do not know, this is a non-profit organization, even though it is sponsored/hosted by Harkins theaters. Every year I try to see some shorts, as well as 1 feature film.
0	Ok I love coffee bean tea leaf, I love that they have more of a tea selection because I'm not a coffee drinker. But I'm disappointed with the way this location makes it. The past three times I've stopped here it's been wrong. Even with me giving them direction. I think they are more consumed with talking to friends then being a barista.
1	My wife took me here a while back, and I always wait for the day I can make it back over there. Very delicious, enjoyed the shaved ice they have!
0	Major disappointment! First of all, I requested a female to do my massage when I called to make my appt. When I got there I was told that there was only a male available. He reaked badly of cigarette smoke and made me nauseous. It was the worst and most horrible 90 minutes I've ever spent on a massage table. Then when I was paying I was pressured by the cashier to tip more than I was comfortable with. I'll never go back to this place nor will I ever suggest it to anyone.
1	It's like a tiny part of my years in Japan, or a stolen Post Street Japantown shopping area from San Francisco!  A nice selection of fresh food, Japanese sweets and cooking reagents, as well as various home products.  Did I mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi?  Good!
1	They deserve five stars, but would also get it by default for being the only place on this side of town I will eat at. Thanks for having that special touch that I cherish in my dining and drinking experience.
1	Located at the main hotel entrance of the Tuscany hotel and casino.  Inexpensive beers and cocktails and a nonsmoking lounge. Happy hour from 5p-7pm except on Monday night football. Live music nightly and a small dance floor.
1	Huge fan of the menu, there are a ton of great looking selections.  I got one of their omelettes this time around and left happy.  The food portions are huge.
0	The biggest problem with this buffet is that the food isn't hot or even very warm.  You'd think with tiny portions they could at least serve the food at a decent temperature. My husband and I arrived soon after they opened for dinner yet the food didn't look fresh. We were looking forward to a delicious anniversary dinner but left disgusted--bloody cold meat and icky seafood. Our waiter was nice and the coffee was rich and hot, other than that, it was a waste of money.
0	I'm giving it two stars for the customer service, the staff was super friendly.  There's a fast food Mexican restaurant (with drive thru) I can get better & cheaper fish tacos from. The taco was dry and I didn't care for the red sauce on it (I guess it was salsa?) I'm surprised by all the positive reviews.
0	My wife and i came in for lunch on a Friday afternoon. There were six people in the bar. The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get a beer I had the fish and chips. The fish came out very soggy and chips were soggy as well.   My wife had the cottage pie. This came very dry as well. There was no gravy at all Overall i dont think we will be back here any time soo
1	Today we had our security screen door serviced and the piston replaced after several years of use. When the technician finished, the door looks brand new!  He went over and above what we expected.  We recommend First Impression again and will tell our family and friends to use this company in Gilbert.
1	What an amazing hotel! The complimentary breakfasts rock, the rooms are spacious and just perfect! Our room had an awesome side view of camelback from the balcony and the quiet environment was the best. Though it was quite chilly to go swimming, I do regret not swimming in their heated pools during my stay. I would definitely stay here again!
1	First time there,I was  in serious bratwurst withdrawals.  Ordered the combo plate of chicken, pork, and something else, with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  Wasn't do thrilled with the sauerkraut, the rest was awesome.wife had pork rotary and gravy I helped her to finish. Also really good. Place is rather loud, but the food was great. Will rotten again
1	Had a great dinner with friends.  Black linguine entree made fresh at the restaurant.Yum. Very unique.  Great service and food.  Like many Scottsdale restaurants, outdoor patio a little small and parking lot facing.  Busy Friday night, so we were seated about 20 minutes past our reservation time, but otherwise a wonderful dining experience.
1	I woekd for el molinos for 17 plus years this place makes FRESH HOMEMADE MEXICAN FOOD !! so all you jokers who eat tex mex mexican food have no clue what good mexican food is i love el molinos and momma and of course lupe all my family and your loss if you dont go back !! BEST MACHACA EVER AND GREEN CORN TAMALES!!!!
0	Wish I could give a zero star score. I will not be going back. I was never offered a drink. And while my steak was cooked perfectly, I wonder how much I had to pay to see cockroaches climbing the walls
0	This place is such a waste of space, it's an absurdly overpriced dump.  Seriously I've been given the wrong sandwich all but 1 time I've been here and that time there was hair in the sandwich.  I only go here because I'm with someone who wants to eat here, I've never chosen this restaurant out of complete freedom of choice.  I can't say enough horrible this about this place save for the usual which is at bad as this place is there is worse out there.
0	My husband and I were so disappointed in the tacos. Super plain and almost raw tortillas and the flavor was bland. We got the mahi and the grouper and both were not good. The price is affordable, but I would pay more for better flavor and quality somewhere else.
1	Best selection of beer downtown. 150+ types of beer and usually has the number 1,2,5,6,8,9,10,11 and 12 highest rated beers in Canada (Beer Advocate).
1	I have a new favorite pizza place in Arizona!!! Haven't been to the Pub yet but it's on my to-do list in the very near future! I love pizza and am sooo glad to have a new place to get it. At Taste of the Trucks I was able to try a few kinds. The Hulk is unbelievable!!! Not very greasy for pizza Bd the crust is thin and perfectly cooked! Can't wait to try more!!!
0	So disappointing. I expected great things from the Aria, but their buffet is comparable to Palms quality if not worse. I love buffets and I love the Aria hotel but I won't be coming back to the buffet unless it's free again. The selection is small and the flavors are mediocre at best. If you have the choice, go to the Bacchanal down the street or even the Wynn. The value there is so, so much better.
0	My chicken pesto sandwich ($13) was so freaking dry! But I was starving so I ate the whole thing. The corned beef and turkey panini looked tastier.
0	Again another Chinese restaurant that pre cooks their sweet and sour chicken and anything that is deep fried. The sauces on the food were mediocre and the meat was dry and overcooked because of the precooked nature of the food.
0	The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.
1	Great Gyro Salad. The gyro meat is really tasty. Friendly staff. Food is done with love so it make take a little bit to get but it's well worth it. Try it. You'll be coming back.
1	Aqua Touch is one of the few retailers that I frequent to stock and replenish my salt water system. I go here because the store is always impeccable, they have an incredible selection of fish/coral/inverts that are always good looking, healthy and priced reasonably. I come here to stock up on pre-mixed water and frozen fish food. Aqua Touch I am a big fan!
1	Outstanding! Great food, great service, great prices, and great atmosphere. We have been coming here since before the grand  opening!
1	I am satisfied with the work that they have done for me on framing my very oversized medical diploma and framing canvas prints that I have actually bought for a deal in this place.  Rock on!!!
1	The most expensive plate of spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had, but also the best. Holy god, it's good. They sure don't make it easy for you, though, as two meatballs are $15 and a plate of spaghetti marinara was $22.   Worth it? Definitely once. Am I coming back? Who knows. That pasta will sure live on in my memories though. Yum.  I'm gonna try and recreate it from the cookbook.
0	Fancy looks, fancy prices.  Not a whole lot of options on the menu.   Got the pork sandwich.  The pork was good, but just not a whole lot of it.   Price per portion is on the high side.
0	okay korean bbq. not enough options on their menu. I can cook my own meat. they cook for you but I can do it on my own. just bring my meat to me
0	We came here around 7:15p tonih we walked in and read the sign that said to seat yourself and we did. The man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in... we waited,  and waited. For about ten minutes we waited for something... anything,  we got nothing... completely ignored. We left, I wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment?
1	The place is pretty uppity, but the food is delicious!!  There is an upstairs, midlevel & downstairs areas. Very swanky/hipster style atmosphere. Fun style that all the servers wear chucks!! Giedre, was our server - took a title warming up to, but she was wonderful!! Best Tip about this place: $36 for the Prime "60 Second" NY Strip Steak - WORTH DOUBLE, most mouthwatering steak I have ever tasted!!
0	Had the chicken, potato and rosemary pizza, it was kind of bland. Friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and said it was nothing spectacular. Pizookie (don't know what they call it here but its a cookie pizza) was the best part. We came right before the dinner rush and as people started trickling in they wanted us out. No refilled water glasses.  Food is nothing special, kind of over priced, service was rushed. Won't be returning probably.
0	Here for the WSOP and figure I'd try their regular poker room. It sucks. There were about 13 people on a wait list and they took about 20 minutes to realize they should start a new table. At the table it took about 1 hour for drink service to come. Then about 45 minutes after taking the order for the drinks to come. The waitress forgot my drink order twice so it was over 2 hours to get 1 drink. Made some money playing NL 1-3 but the action is super slow.
0	My wife and I had lunch there today and I had the beef brisket and my wife had the baby back ribs. We were very disappointed in both dishes because the ribs were very dry, tough, and no flavor. Both of us love baby back ribs and these were the worse we have had. The Brisket was the same way dry and no flavor. Our server did not give us any napkins and we had to ask for tableware and napkins. We will not eat here again due to poor tough meats and high priced for what we ordered.
1	I thought that Le Peep's was very good.  I liked how it was not such a big place, but the right size.  I had ordered the Desperado skillet and really enjoyed it.  It was a pretty big size that I wasn't expecting so much!  I had to bring some of it home.  It was still tasty when I ate it later.  I do recommend this place.
1	Ta-ta-ta-tastyyyyyyy!!! If you want a stellar, tasty, affordable lunch to nurse that 'party-too-hard-the-night-before' feeling...you MUST try Capriotti's.   The spot is clean and staff is super friendly, though it's a little off the beaten path it's worth it! I highly recommend the 'Bobbie' &/or the 'SlawBeJoe'
0	Ordered the veggie burger. It tasted OK. The patty fell apart without even picking it up! Service was sslowwwwww. It wasn't like it was busy @ the time we ate there, either! Plus, either waitress forgot to add my onion rings to the tag or the cooks neglected to make them. Not impressed! Next time, I'll go to Burger Bar for a good burger.
0	I will never us this company again and will go out of my way to sway anyone I talk to, also to never use them.  They have never heard of normal wear and tear of the property if your place doesn't look exactly the way they expect it to be you will lose most of your deposit, and it not a little one.
0	Pretty rude telling us to wait and then on top of it they do not accept the Starbucks cards here.  We walked out....too bad cuz we are gold card holders too.  Will not return to this location based on the rude service alone.  Across the street is a much friendlier location I am reviewing the Starbucks inside the Barnes and Noble.....terrible
1	Truly caring doctor who is concerned about your personal needs, I find this hard to find now. Have no doubt in my mind that I would go anywhere else, great practice and amazing doctor!
1	Dr. Sam and his staff are very professional, courteous, and friendly. Growing up I always dreaded going to the dentist because of all the pain associated with the cleanings and fillings. However now,  I am very comfortable in the care of Dr. Partovi and his staff. Each time I visit, they make me at ease, and always provide great service. My husband and two children are also Dr. partovi's patients, and they are very satisfied with him and his dental office.
1	Great food...a little pricey.  Basic pasta is about $16 and the meat dishes range from $20-35.  I had salmon...it was amazing!  When my boyfriend at the time and I ate there while it was still nice out, so we were able to sit outside and people watch.  Also, because they share owners, the acts that perform at the Majestic often eat there, so keep an I out for them. Check out my Majestic review for a good story about that!  Great food and lots of options, whatever you are in the mood for.  4 stars.
0	Only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order. Chili verde was ok but not worth $11. Husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland.
1	Nice play to enjoy a burger and watch all the weirdos walk by. I like the atomic fries, blue cheese burger and also the jack Daniels burger. If you are an industry worker they'll give you 25% off.
1	Have to go get nailed and lashed!!!   This is a new salon on sunset and fort apache...great location, amazing staff...everyone is so friendly and very welcoming!!!! Book your appt today!!!
0	Totally unimpressed. Way to expressive and was rushed off our lane 10 mins before we even finished. I was with a group of girls and we opened a tab on my card and the server encouraged them to just bill my card
1	Pretty damn good! Small but very filling. The sandwich (Chipotle Chicken Avocado) was fresh and hot, great taste. Just enough of each ingredient; balanced. The bread was fresh and soft too! The price is cheap, but it's a far from cheap sandwich!
0	Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .
1	This is my roommate's favorite AYCE sushi in town, and I'm always happy with a good crunch roll. My friends adore the seafood salad and no-name roll.
0	o sole mio.. o sole mio...  I forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank.. Says a lot about this chain restaurant.  While it does not dissapoint, it is not memorable at all. The hostess was kinda grumpy. We had an extra person , and she had to move us.. and she was all huff and puff.. I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad? Anyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here..
1	I went to this place last week. Was a lil scared cause I don't like going to new places for my eyebrows an I have never had threading done before. I absolutely loved it! Marci did such a great job an it was so quick! Def going back.
0	$5.45 for a bowl of soup and 1/2 a roll (literally the roll was sliced in half). While the broccoli cheese soup is very good I could get more for my money elsewhere....a lot more!
1	Boy do I miss Primate Bros.  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out 'n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70's).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their T-shirts...but alas...left it with a native friend (she also liked it alot) in Koh Samui Thailand.
1	Great place for BBQ in Anthem. When you get a chance try their creation called the Hog Dog, don't be scared it's not as spicy as the description may imply. The Ribs are better than average, the fried macaroni and cheese lacks flavor. As for everything else on the menu, it's great. I can say that because I have tasted the whole menu already.
1	GIRL REVIEW (Obviously different) Obviously I had a damn good time. Highlights? Outdoor section, beautiful pool and VIP cabanas. A lot of stripper poles
1	The pretzels balls. ARE YOU JOKING ME.  Delicious and a sick little place to have dinner. Very modern vintage in the place and good for a night out with the girls to have drinks and apps.  Agave margs, yum
1	Allways loved this place. This location is nice and looks like it was newly renovated. Very clean. Kalbi ribs are juicy and sweet.  Spam musubi are fav(:
0	the rio is an overpriced waste of time and money! The 22 year old building is falling apart and all the ac vents are moldy and blow swamp cooler hot air. For $275 a night you can go anywhere else and be better off. The staff is rude and I consider this to be my worse Vegas decision ever (and there have been a ton of bad decisions haha). The voodoo club sucks, and seriously if you pop the cover off any vent they are covered in mold. Gross.
1	I love this place. Sometimes the pad thai is hit or miss though, hence why only 4 stars. I love the lunch specials: soup, salad, egg roll, and dish for $8.25? Perfect deal. Soup is wonderful, as is the egg roll! I don't eat salad but I'm sure it's great too!
1	This place is fast becoming my favorite AYCE spot here in Vegas - it has been more reliably good than any other. Tasty appetizers (especially the garlic chicken), good quality fish and quick service make me want to keep coming back here.
1	We met at the park to carpool to the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center.  I wasn't there long, but it was long enough to know that I wanted to come back and walk to the top of the hill that overlooks the Las Vegas Valley. The facilities looked like they were well taken care of and the children's area had a stage coach that the kids were playing in and having a great time.  There are a lot of sidewalks through the area and it seems a great place to walk or jog.
0	WOW..........all I can say is that the reviews for this restaurant under its original name Inka Chicken were so bad they change the name & took down the worst of the reviews. Bad, Bad, Bad, stay away unless you know the new owner personally, only then you might get good service & not get ignored. Don't be fooled Che Inka is the same place.
1	Park on Fremont is definitely worth a try. The staff is very nice and drinks are reasonably priced. The indoor seating is very limited, but there are plenty of tables outside- in the front and back.  I find the decor very interesting...country meets hipster.  There is always a great drink special, $10 for a shot and beer (I go with a Dos Equis and a shot of Patron).  Also, the fried pickles are AMAZING.  And I'm a pickle enthusiast :)
1	Really good breakfast.  Not sure why it has some bad reviews from people, because the 2 dishes my wife and I got were really good.  I had the banana french toast (will order with extra syrup on the side next time) and the meatloaf hash with eggs.  Both were good and huge.  We also got an orange crush champagne spritzer, which was good despite the fact that it sounds strange.  I would also try the bloody mary's next time since it looked like they made their own mix and everybody was ordering them.
0	A bit disappointing. Service was blah. We went here because of a coupon which was good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They couldn't take it because it was Sunday and they were serving "BRUNCH"! I get it now! The people there could care less if you eat there or not or if you like it. I did have an extensive amount of crab legs which were just OK. Certainly not the best around the area for sure.
1	Love the food. Potato wedges come in a very large portion for $4. Add some fish tacos from the happy hour menu (2 for $5)and you are set. This is the same fish as the fish and chips, great crispy battered pieces. The service can be a bit slow but the folks always seem friendly, even with nondrinkers in the party. Lots of room and it is always nice to be able to choose where you want to sit. Lots of TVs around for the sports minded.
0	Reserved a car for noon. Showed up late (my fault) to find they rented my car to someone else; didn't bother to call me (their fault). Both employees were on the phone when we got there and didn't bother to acknowledge us for at least 5 minutes. They said they could get me another car from another location if I was willing to wait 45 min. So Make sure you call or show up on time because their inventory is like 2 cars.
1	My barber is Marco, Always punctual! I love it, been going to him every week for 4 years now and i dont plan on changing. When I set appts hes always ready on time and makes me feel like a VIP. Ive went to other barbers if he was off or the 1 time he was out sick and they all do great
0	I just don't get this place.  The atmosphere is trying to be upscale, the desserts look upscale, but they simply don't taste all that great to me.  Totally not worth the money.
1	Had a gyro, and is one of the best ones I've ever had. I'm from Chicago so I'm critical when it comes to gyros, beefs, pizza and hot dogs. Still have to try the other foods here though.
0	I went to Gus's once and haven't been back. There was loud electronic music playing the whole time, so it was really hard to talk. I had the sloppy joe, which was good, but overpriced seeing that no side came with it. Just a really weird experience.
1	I always stuff myself at TT2 , the food is that wonderful.  I live close by and have been eating here once a month for a few years now.  It never fails me.  Even their desserts are well crafted, and the free Chai is a delight.  A solid, classic neighborhood curry house that brings a smile to my tummy whenever I visit, and I visit often.  You should as well!
1	As for the hotel, this is probably one of the most modern hotels on the strip if not the most. which is why i like it so much. It goes with people in my demographic which is Gen X and Y. But hey it has a nice gaming floor and nice pit bosses. Interesting note... This is owned by Deutsche Bank. lol anyways I also wanted to say that i've never actually stayed in here but i plan on to in the near future. The food could be better really nothing to note there but yeah, it gets the job done... (food wise)
0	That was GROSS. Some of the worst sushi and worst service I have ever received in my life. I LOVE sushi and am very disappointed not only in the service and food but also in the way the manager handled the situation (or FAILED to handle). I have been a server, manager and NEVER complain. But I cannot believe how awful this was. I'm praying I don't get food poisoning.
0	Unfortunately, they are out of business.  Looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago.  I have eaten there twice and it was very good. Don;t know why they closed but they had a Thank You banner posted for their customers.   Too bad.
1	Great Food.  Great Drinks.  Always somewhat snotty ladies greeting you up front. (I'm with my wife, no, I am not being a creep)   otherwise----- I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!   Have the Ahi Tuna Appetizer- nothing like it anywhere! Cucumber Martini! Always great steaks, pasta, everything.  Never had bad food here.
1	Jason is very friendly and genuinely helpful when answering all the questions I have on insurance.  I don't typically enjoy talking with insurance people because they usually are trying to over sell me on something and not really listening to my needs. Jason was great to talk with at length because he was non pushy and didn't dodge around topics I needed answers on. I continue to rely on Jason and you should to.
0	If hanging around a bunch a douchy frat boys is your style then get here early BC you wont want to miss out on all of the fun. The place is dingy and the food really stinks. As bars go this is the kind of spot that high schoolers would go to with their fake ids and would fit right in.
1	Cover up tattoo by Lloyd this week... I love it, it's better than I imagined it could be!   Lloyd is a true artist who just started drawing and reworking the piece until it was  amazing!
0	Menu seemed underwhelming.  Took my 8 year old daughter to breakfast Saturday morning before work. We are both light eaters,  the easiest thing w could order was two eggs over easy with a side of bacon and sausage, my coffee age her chocolate milk. Waited 30 minutes and paid $33?!?!? Nothing on the menu enticed me to return again. But it's walking distance to work. Hope their lunch is better
0	Don't go here if you are gluten free. Our server was pretty clueless and they couldn't prepare gf sushi. My food was cooked in the back, came out cold and I had half of what everyone else had. Had a reaction to my food. Def got glutened. Also had to ask several times for water. My friend got the complete wrong sushi order.  Not a great time at all.
1	This place is the perfect location for drinks before/after a show at the Overture! I wish they were open when I used to live down here. There's a pool table, and the place feels very spacious. I wish they had more sofa-like seating though. I can imagine people playing board games down here.
0	I was totally bored with everything in this place. The service was so so, the food was so so and unfortunately we didn't get a good view seat so the dining room was so so.
0	Like Clay P who posted before me, I too love pancakes. Though I love chocolate chip pancakes. But like Clay I did not love the ones that I got a the Original Pancake House. Typically, restaurants just don't do it the way I like them and I have come to expect that. Grading OPH on those terms, they did a respectable job. It is definitely a worthwhile destination for a pancake lover.
0	WARNING! Check to see if they give you EXACTLY what you ordered if it is to go..They never get the order right..Whoever owns this place should look into replacing this incompetent staff of low IQ teenagers.
1	Lincoln Square Mall is dead but this place isn't.  The place is small but has a cozy feel.  Service is fairly nice.  Lots of good things on the menu: lamb, steak, upside-down pizzas, etc.  Dessert menu is fairly standard but they do have an assortment of teas served in single French presses.  Price is good, too.
1	Earl of Sandwich is a great sandwich place.  It is the hybrid of a Quizno's sub with a hot pocket.  Pretty cheap for a Vegas food option.  The location here at the Palms is nowhere near as crazy as the one in Planet Hollywood.  It is also a bit smaller.  Each time I have come here there were no lines.    I have tried all of their sandwiches and thought they were all pretty good, with Montague and tuna being the standouts.
1	Came here after having dinner at top of the world.  I had a great time here, the staff was super friendly and the drinks were excellent.  If you want to enjoy the view from the stratosphere but don't want to pay to eat at Top of the world, this is a great way to experience it!
1	This place is awesome. It is the Costco of booze stores. We went in for one mini keg and came out with a cart full of goodies. This place has the best prices I have ever seen in the states.
1	Raymond was the best discount tire employee to help me in years. I have bought at least 3 sets of tires from Discount Tire over the years and no one has helped me like he did. Very helpful and friendly. Great guy and a great experience. All done in less than an hour.
0	All those people that claim Mike Ferry is hard ass about taking your money are right. He is old school flim flam man. Gets you to sign a contract and takes your blood. Stay away IMO.
1	I recently had them assigned to my house by my home warranty. They are a customer oriented business that is interested in your satisfaction.
1	Had an issue with a radiator blow out while I was down the street from them so I decided to give them a shot. They were very friendly, showed me what was wrong and what needed to be replaced and took care of me very quickly!
1	This restaurant is hard to describe.  The restaurant itself and the menu are really simple, breakfast staples, but they are done so well that they taste better! All ingredients are local and organic.   I always try to do the "special", which is usually a type of scramble.  Always delicious!  There are only about 7 tables in the whole place, so I left off a star for the wait you will see on the weekends.  However, it is 100% worth the wait!
1	Great option if you want good food and a low hassle restaurant that's on the strip. The burgers were decent, but we just wanted a quick meal that wasn't at a fast food chain or a high end restaurant. Location can't be beat. There was a short wait though, maybe five to ten minutes.
1	We ate tonight at Nitaya, and our food was excellent.  I had the Pineapple Chicken Curry and my wife had a Modified Number 77.  We had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and Mango for dessert.  The only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated, but for authentic Thai, this was it.  The service was great and no problems with English understanding him or us.
1	There are two things here that I love that you can't really find anywhere else. The fried rice and the hakata ramen. I know you can find fried rice everywhere, but their's is just ... different. The ramen is my absolute fave ... I find myself craving it all the time. The service can leave something to be desired sometimes, but all the servers are very nice and you can usually tell they're trying. Nice little neighborhood place. :)
1	My friends are regulars at Roma Garden and I've joined them there several times now. The service is good, the food is great. Huge portions and they'll custom order for you when they have the ingredients on hand. They don't rush you through your meal and have a nice balance of attentive but not intrusive service. The free Amaretto at the end of the meal is an added bonus.
1	Great spot for late night eats. The carne asada tacos were street taco size, and were filled with delicious marinated beef. They were $1.50 each. We also had some horchata, which wasn't super sweet like how other kinds can get, and was very cool and refreshing. I didn't see any hours posted on the door, but we were there on a Saturday night at 11 P.M. and they were still open.
1	The beer was great, as was Matt. Well worth seeking out. Do the sampler, something for everyone. Don't need to dress up, but bring the girls down. They will find a beer they will love.
1	Ok the place is gross like really really disgusting but the food including the cookie ( that comes with the meal) is AMAZING!!! It's a crazy mix, a crazy delicious mix don't miss out because it's in a creepy spot just make sure u park your car close to the window and lock your doors : ) it's not really that bad!
1	They have clam chowder on Sundays - best I've ever had! Kids can eat breakfast for dinner which is great for my pickiest.  Overall great food and staff! We will try again!
1	I have loved Coca Cola for years and to come here was pretty cool! Everything Coca Cola is loaded with anything you can think of with the logo on it. Glasses, t shirts, calendars, hats, games and the actual soda this place has it and more. Its very fun for a Coke enthusiast. You can get a nice lil bottle of Coke for a buck, how awesome is that! Plus you can take fun pictures with the polar bear statue, good times!
0	While their BBQ is pretty good, the little breakfast burritos they make in the morning are not. I ordered about six of these greasy things to share with my coworkers and felt sick the rest of the day. I am pretty sure they gave me the scoots. Avoid their breakfast, because the food will make you sick and regretful.
0	If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down. Also, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.
0	I went to this place thinking I could get a good hair cut, but I was wrong. The hair stylist was friendly, I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair and for the most part it was going well. Until she cut my bangs, she cut off way too much from the side and now I look like I'm back in elementary school. Then when it came to paying, I tried to use my credit card but they didn't even have a working machine. I was very disappointed in this place.
1	Convenient place for quality pasta.  I had a custom order of whole wheat penne pasta, with marinas sauce, shrimp, roasted garlic and tomatoes.  Good weight watchers meal.
1	What great customer service!  I needed to purchase straw for a pumpkin patch we were putting together for an event and I called back several times with questions and changes.  Each time, the lady on the phone (wish I had her name) was so patient and I truly appreciated that.  Their driver Chris was amazing and so kind!  I would recommend Western Ranchman to anyone!  Thank you for delivering excellent customer service!
1	Even though most juices are pretty expensive, I have become a believer in the ones from Kaleidoscope. I drank their Flu Shot juice the other day. It was strong but it was Oh SO Good! I've also tried a few other drinks of theirs but I still haven't been able to try the Grapefruit one since it's always sold out. That's one of the downsides of this place besides price. Their juices sell out quick quick quick! I follow them on FB and that's how I find out when new juices, free juices, etc. become available.
1	Stingray is consistent in their terrific quality of food and drinks. M-F from 3-7 is a great happy hour. You can't expect things to come out in 5 minutes when the restaurant and bar are busy.  Relax and enjoy the atmosphere and music. Great people watching. Fantastic patio. Delicious drinks. Friendly (and pretty!) bartenders and servers.
0	The pizza has always been pretty good here. However, we had an AWFUL experience with customer service. Unfortunately, they have now lost our business.
0	Everytime I've gone there the food has been very disappointing. The employees just slap the food together with no care of concern for the customers. Also the coffee was horrible the one time I tried it! The manager is difficult to understand and tries to upsell you on everything! I would not recommend this place.
1	If you love burgers, you'll love Bachi. Their burger patties are juicy and flavorful. Their menu gives a good variety of burger choices from the cheese burger to Vietnamese Bahn Mi burger. I also loved the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries topped with a fried egg.  Making my mouth water just thinking about it. Mmmmmmm...
0	No quality for your money! We ordered salmon, happy pork chop and pork tenderloin, which needed to be prepared over an hour (?), so we took an appetizer, onion soup, this was only cheese, no bouillon ;-( not good. Wine was was good, but very expensive. A no go! There are better places to spend your money!
1	My boyfriend said "this is the best pizza he's ever had in his entire life" and I agree. It really is a secret... A waiter from a previous restaurant told us about it when we mentioned we were staying at the Cosmo. I had a vegetarian salad and it was extremely fresh. The guy at the register was super friendly and super cute which only made my experience here better:) you have to ask a security guard where it is exactly....I honestly felt cool knowing about this secret:):)
1	Can I just say "Thirsty Thursday"? Raspberry Vodka Cake topped with a Vanilla Buttercream and drizzled with a Raspberry Coulis--OMG! My absolute fav is "Kayla"--vanilla cake/lime curd/lime cream cheese. She's seasonal, but I'll wait!!!
1	For $10 you get chicken katsu, rice, miso soup, and a cabbage salad. Everything was amazing! Who would of thought to grind up sesame seeds into the katsu sauce?!? It was delicious! I also ordered soft shell crab appetizer which was amazing! Thanks to my friend Jessica for taking me there! I am definitely going back again!
1	Very consistent, good food, service, and atmosphere. The only thing not consistent are the hatch chilies, which is understandable because they come in and out of season, but when they're hot, they're HOT! Favorites are the hatch chili especial and roswell tacos.
1	Overpriced but what isn't in Las Vegas? The restaurant is clean, elegant, quiet, and a bit secluded from the hustle and bustle of the strip despite being on it.   we went for a light lunch and had the margarita pizza. I love a good margarita pie and I enjoyed it but for my husband, it was just cheese pizza.
1	I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome. A perfectly cooked medium rare with soup ,appetizer platter and dessert buffet  for around $24 is a pretty awesome deal for me. The service was very good. The meat is most likely not "PRIME" cut but for the price it was delicious. This experience this time around was way better. I would definitely eat here again.
0	FOOD POISONING!!  It tasted good going down, not so good coming up and out.  Ruined my Christmas trip to Vegas.  I will forever spread the word to not eat there.
1	First and only visit to a QT.  The young lady at the register greeted me as I walked in.  Nice.  Very clean for a convenience store.  I just don't agree with the buy 2 drinks for $3.30, but get 1 for $2.  I see it here, in Indiana and every where I've traveled.   Attentive service for the 5 minutes I was there.
1	I love Lush products and its located in our Hotel... well sign me up!!!  Had amazing service on December 28th by a young lady I can not recall her name but what a great gal! She was super helpful and got me to spend more than I wanted too!! :) Not that its hard at Lush..  now my bathroom smells yummy at home and so did my hotel room! :) Can't wait for Fashion Island's to open!
1	Delightful!  2 pieces of pizza and drink for $4 AND its delicious!  The crust is light and thin, flavors are terrific.  Give this place a try!
0	Took 55 minutes to get our food (ckn sand, ckn strips and hot dog). Waitress was soooooo slow. After she finally came to pick up my credit card, it took her almost 15 minutes to bring it back to me because she was chatting with the table behind us about her personal life. I really expected more from this place. Pure disappointment.
1	Rock-n-Roll Yoga is really a good class. Or maybe it's that Natalie (Martina? Nikola? Sorry, I don't remember) is a good teacher. Good voice, good rhythm. The rock-n-roll part wasn't as rockin' as I'd hoped, but that's ok, it was still fun. 45 minutes, great for a vacation-sized class. I'd give the class 3 stars, but it gets 4 because of the aweeeesome locker room which is super convenient for going to class then changing and going to the pool. All in all, a good experience!
1	We always enjoy coming to this casino once a year for a little bit of fun. I always end up on the slot machines while the hubs will play a round of poker. The only thing that confuses me is that in Vegas there are waitresses walking around getting you drinks. I have not seen that here and don't know if they even do it. We can still have fun even if we're not drinking, though. ;)
0	I can't say I agree that the food is good. This was the first time we tried this place. The cost versus the quality doesn't match up. Can't say I'll ever order from here again. And the people on the phone seemed confused at best. I was on hold for 3 minutes and never told how long my food would take. Very disappointed.
0	We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?
0	I will never come here again and I recommend that you don't either. Poor customer service noone is even here and we have been waiting for 30 minutes. Then someone comes in after us and they are seen before us? The lady at the front desk /the dentist clearly has an attitude problem and doesn't know what they are doing. I have had better service at the DMV in south phoenix!
1	I came here as a nervous newly engaged girl. Tiffany helped me to pick out the dresses I wanted and then recommended some that I might like. Even if I don't buy my dress there, I would recommend it to anyone in the wedding party.
0	5 friends playing blackjack at one table. Dealer did not know rules of game she was dealing. 1 1/2 pay on BJ, she insisted and payed as 1 on BJ, pit boss eventually noticed and corrected. Dealer then unable to remember 3 BJ at table realy? WTF its a pit don't go.
0	I have been forced to come here many times as I am part of a networking group that meets here. I have been to a LOT of establishments in the valley. In regards to how the food tastes....this among the worst tasting food in Chandler. Awful awful awful food!
0	Offering everything from Chinese food to pizza to burgers, this eatery is good if you need something in a hurry and don't have high expectations. Quite frankly, I haven't dared try the Chinese food.  I did have a cheeseburger and shrimp cocktail recently.  The shrimp cocktail, at 99 cents, is a bargain and is much improved over the one I had here years ago.  The burger was over cooked, and I had a fairly long wait to be served with my burger.
1	Support your local small business. This is an independent pharmacy on the Southwest side of town. They will value your business and treat you with care and compassion. Give them a shot and you won't be disappointed. They accept most insurance. Really fast, friendly service. I get all my prescriptions filled there now.
1	This place is awesome! Super clean, well-staffed, has friendly employees, and an amazing selection of polish colors!  I could probably go as far to say this was the best pedicure I have ever had! I got the Classic Pedicure ($28). My technician really took her time with me and believe me, it is greatly appreciated! They even had a wait, but nobody was rushing through their current client just to get to the people waiting. AWESOME! I will be back!
1	Went during the dinner rush with a party of seven, not smart, I know. The bartenders were great, though, getting us drinks and a couple of appetizers while we waited. Seats at the bar opened up and we ended up just eating there. Chrissy and Mark(?) were both great. Chrissy took the time to explain all of the choices for the create your own burger and every one of us loved the food.  Great food, great service on a madhouse of a shift.
0	If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their "prison" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers.
1	Amazing. We ordered a dozen fresh raw oysters, a dozen Rockerfellers, and a dozen of the deep-fried ones. In the future I'd probably get all raw ones! They were SO good and delicious. The fried ones were more batter and flour than oyster, so I would stay away from those if given a choice between the three.  There's not much to be said of the ambiance. It's too bad, because the oysters are SO GOOD. This place would probably be busier if it weren't a Monday night at 4:30pm. And if it weren't at Harrah's.
1	My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome!  Great place, we will be back!
1	Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE.  The place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new. the food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good.
0	We hadn't been here for several years and got a coupon so decided to try again for dinner .  First impression - DARK!   Seriously, so dark we can't read the menu (servers had to provide flashlights) and then could barely see our food.  Food was OK, but a bit pricey for what we got and service was a bit slow and sporadic.  We got a sopapilla for desert and it was strangely salty and sweet.  Overall, "Meh" was our reaction.  Probably won't be back.
0	RIGHTS VIOLATION ALERT! My wife had an appointment for a blood pregnancy test. We walk in for the appointment, and they refuse to do the test. Then they wouldn't allow me back there with her for her appointment. They  also forced her to recount events that happened several years ago, which threw her into a full-blown panic attack/PTSD attack. They still wouldn't allow me back there with her. So if you care about your loved ones at all, don't bother with this place.
1	I'm going to cry- did this place seriously close? DEVASTATED. One of the top reasons we stay at the Wynn is to be within 2 minutes walking distance of this restaurant. I'd have mouth-watering dreams about their sushi. So bummed, bad move Wynn!
1	At Ruth's last night, setting is great the views of camelback are great from patio with the restaurant being on second floor.  Staff was great very friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the filet and lobster which was amazing only downside steak came out cooked more than I asked for.  The sides were ok and the desert was awesome.  I will be returning!
1	Bakery Wee created our baby shower cake, which was amazing!!!!  The taste was just as great as the looks!!!  Hoping to get our sons birthday cake done as well!!
1	This place has some good food and is a nice place to hang with friends after a good workout. I usually get a burger here and they come out pretty good. They have a bunch of beers on tap and the interior of the place is set up nicely. Live music some nights and a game room with darts and pool tables as well. The patio outside is great if you're a smoker (not me though). Prices are average to higher but at least it's going towards a real restaurant and not a chain.
1	This is the theater to visit for obscure movies of a kind that are seldom seen in my small town. The theatre has five screens for theaters of varying sizes. The staff is always friendly. The concession area is small compared to most theaters but there isn't room for much more. At the end of a movie the restrooms are crowded. Parking is not much of a problem during weekdays but on a weekend can be a challenge. When in Scottsdale we do our best to get here. It is a special place and I fear it may not last.
0	This gym needs a remodel!!!!! It is so outdated for the area and clients that consistently come here. If they even read these do something with this place!!! There are way better places popping up now and I more and more likely will be changing soon, this isnt worth $30 a month
0	Do NOT eat here my husband got food poisoning. My husband went to ceasar's and had lunch at Plant Hollywood he ordered a turkey sandwich with fries sounds harmless, well later that day he got the worst case of food poisoning that landed him at the ER.
1	The food & atmosphere at Sushi Rock is awesome. My favorite items to get include the Bento Boxes (the chicken is yummi), the crunchy rolls, and the Udon! They have an Udon & Roll special during lunch which is a fantastic bang for your buck! I definitely miss this place since i've moved off campus!
1	Exploring this old downtown area I was not expecting to find this!  Cool Comic Book store!  The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable!
0	I will never come here again...  HORRIBLE service and mediocre cupcakes.  The lady behind the counter, for lack of a better word, was a huge B****.  Literally.  It was like she was on the first day of her period and someone took away her midol and chocolate.  And to top it off the cupcakes weren't that great.  Avoid like the plague.
0	On several occasion I have stopped at this location to refuel, and for the past five months every time I try and use my Chevron credit to save money, the automatic credit card for Chevron is unable to authorize purchase. Recently I drive an additional 2 miles on Durango and I have no problem at all using my Chevron credit card.  Un doubly Terrible herbst has a scam going with all of there location. BEWARE
1	Charming, fun and very lively - perfect for a long lunch filled with wine. Some may say its a bit too touristy (100% french - music, food, etc.) but the delicious food and overall charm make up for it. Appetizer plats to share are delicious and the fondue and wine are a must. It gets crowded so be ready to get cozy with the neighbors.
1	One of the coolest places I would've never expected to find in Uptown Charlotte. Feel like I stepped off Church St. and into a little corner of the Emerald Isle. Definitely worth a visit. Grab an irish pint in this cozy pub and enjoy some good darts or soccer on the tv.
0	So after 15 years having the best bloody marys around you changed your mix.  The watered down tomato juice out of the gun was horrible.  Drinks use to be good and over priced now they are horrible and over priced.  Won't be enjoying a cocktail here anymore.
1	Amazing sandwiches! So many options and there's even more online! The sandwiches are HUGE! My fiancé and I both ended up only eating half and he can eat, so I would recommend sharing a sandwich if you don't like leftovers. Great music as well.
0	Me and my partner has been bringing our adorable dog here since she was a pup and every time it has been pleasent except for today.......... Usually one of the nice girls cleans and trims our dog's nails and never once has there been an issue, but today some guy done her grooming and when we got in the car her nails look like they were butchered and she still smells the same........just for future reference they have lost my business
0	Skip it if you are a vegetarian or health conscious.  I had a piece of fish which I ordered "plain".  I guess I should have specified 'not soaked in butter and oil sauce'. The chopped salad was OK.  The breads tick was a soft pretzel stick.  For a $50 meal this was mediocre at best. It was worth about $12. The wait staff was great -  fast,  friendly and the ideal level of attention.  Too bad the food is overpriced and not so great.
0	When we were passing through town we stopped at The Horny Toad for lunch. I have to say my experience was just "ok".  The chicken noodle soup lacked any substance.  My girlfriend had the chile and commented that said "shes had better".  We sat outside on the picnic tables which is a cute spot but certaily nothing special.  I doubt I would make a special trip to town just to go to this place.  Server however was expeptional and staff very friendly.
1	This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. Service is absolutely wonderful, food is delicious and I love coming to a place that that just feels like home. My husband and I have tried any dishes and each one becomes a favorite:)
0	Came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Told our Gyros and Vegetarian plate would take 15 minutes.  An hour later, the food finally came.  Gyros was marginal - the pita was cold and not toasted.  Falafel was mealy.  Salad was soaked in dressing.  just a horrible experience.  The cook was nice and apologized for the slow service.  The counter lady was irritated that we asked about the status of our order.  And $20.00 for this fast food experience!
0	Bottom line got a quote over the phone. Person said he would waive a $25 fee. When driver got there they did not in fact waive the fee and ended up charging me almost double what they quoted, to tow a car literally less than half a mile.
0	They destroy my drink 8/10 times and their baristas are quite rude. For one of the busiest Starbucks in Scottsdale, they lack quite a bit. I stopped coming to this Starbucks. I now go to the other one inside the store off the freeway.
1	As soon as we arrived from the long drive from Cali, I told my fiancé we had to go try this place. Perfect place to go if you are starving! Portions are HUGE and the prices are reasonable.  I got the mushroom, artichoke, sun dried tomato, spinach hash omelette and my fiancé got Andy's sage fried chicken hash. It's MASSIVE and I didn't finish it.  After eating, I was totally in a food coma. Overall, the wait wasn't  bad on a Friday morning, service was good. We will definitely come back for more!
0	Whoa. I got a $10 burrito that looked and tasted like a 99 cent bean and cheese burrito from del taco. Nice job, guys. At least the laughter kept my belly full.
1	This place is absolutely amazing! The ambience is trendy and and relaxing. The food was delicious. I had the carnitas. The meat was so tender and served on the bone. The margaritas here are out of this world. They claim their margaritas are the best in the world and I haven't had one better. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!!
1	Japanese food at its finest wanted to do the eat all you can sushi, but wanted to try this place this the reviews were glad to say that Naked Fish did not disappoint. Will be trying the other dishes when we come back here.
1	Today I decided to try Amigos Tacos to see if it would compare to Roberto's, which I think is pretty decent for cheap Mexican food. I have to say, I was VERY impressed with the quality and flavor or the food. I ordered the Carnitas Chimichanga combination plate and it truly was one of the best ones I've had in Vegas. Everything was well cooked, seasoned, and fresh tasting. After this experience, I'm making the switch, sorry Roberto's...Amigos just kicked your ass in my book.
0	Oh dear Diablo Cantina... No more specialty cocktails for you. If the Sinful Vixen was just a taste of what your bartenders have up and created I think I should have a whack at altering your recipes. I will say this though their cocktails might be bad but the chips and salsa is delicious and well the bartenders aren't too shabby themselves.
0	I  didn't like the selection I had to choose from and the insurance was too high $24 and some change.  I won't rent from them again anytime soon.  They have kids as staff which I didn't care for at all, I would have had a better deal if I went to the airport which I didn't want to do, the return to the other office on Paradise was a better place to go and they dropped me off at home.  No I would not recommend
0	Second time I've been here and it's still the same. We ordered the "vegas" style all you can eat because we liked the Kalbi. Everything is tasty yet the service there is absolutely horrible. We didn't get any plates, water, and rice when all of our meat came out. Whenever we asked for more water or more for some help with our grill, we got an attitude and had to wait more. Took us about 3 hours to get done instead of an hour or two if we had good service. Won't come here again.
0	The food is So So, but my husband and a coworker got the Oysters to start with  and the two of them ended up with food poisoning!   The vegetarain options on their set menu are not great.  Their risotto was not cooked enough, i know risotto is supposed to have bite, but this was ridiculous i was chewing forever!   This year i told the company not to bring us back here! Maybe I will go to Sirio instead... so much better!
0	DO NOT USE 24/7 LOCKSMITH!!!  They quoted me a price and when they came out told me it was going to cost exactly 10 times what they quoted me. The locksmith then has gone on to repeatedly text me very inappropriate things. I cannot stress enough NOT to use this company!
0	inexpensive doesn't have to mean gross. that place hasn't been cleaned in ages, the baskets hanging from the ceiling are so dustry, it makes me want to vomit. the food is diner-quality and their cooked apples are gross (plus i hate cooked apples). it's small and stuffy and reminds me of a dirty grandmother's house. They need to renovate and revamp the menu. the only reason they're still open is because Montreal has loads of cheapos.
0	I had the lemongrass beef and eggroll, literally just one eggroll. I was pretty disappointed with my food and the eggroll just didn't taste right. Growing up in a town with a big Vietnamese community and eating at their restaurants on a regular basis, it's pretty safe to say lemongrass cafe's food is not that great in comparison and I'm probably not coming back.
0	Service was very good. Our waitress was nice and stopped by a lot. The meat skewers came fast and furious. Problem was, the meat was not that great and the "salad" bar was okay, but nothing special.
0	This place doesn't even deserve any stars. The manager that owns this place is a total asshole and talks shit about his customers. Not worth giving them money to keep them in business.
1	Family owned and run...  The barber staff does a great job listening to what you want, so the welcome your specific haircut details.  Boris is the owner, who can cut with the best of them, but the entire staff is very detail oriented and gives great haircuts.  Highly recommended for anyone getting a haircut in North Phoenix or Scottsdale.
1	Love this place! Great rooms, great bar/restaurant, access to Golds gym, free coffee in the morning, happy hour in the evening, good service and awesome location within walking distance to tons of stuff. I always stay here when I am in Phoenix.
1	Great service, clean, and fair prices. I have been using this salon for close to 6 years and the staff are all very good at manicures and pedicures. I haven't had waxing done at this salon so I can't comment on that. But if you want a good pedicure, manicure, fill, or gel nails, this salon is one of the better salons in Mesa.
0	I went with my wife for lunch we were curious since we use to go to Penguin, and was a little disappointed the food was bland and the service was just o.k.
1	After having mock meat meals at a number of restaurants across the world, this place ranks up there. A group of 4 can eat every item from the buffet menu.  Go hungry, drink lots of water. The sodium content does catch up with you.  Closed off the meal with some red bean ice cream.  Will be back here next time to finish the rest of the menu.
1	I passed by this place and just decided to try it. I tried their burger. Man..it was so good. Best bang for the buck. Especially if you're a student.. I had plenty of fries. Completely stuffed. =) Definitely coming back here again.
1	Really cool atmosphere. I had the watermelon rose cocktail, which was awesome!, and the albacore tataki. The appetizer had a bit too much dressing, but the concept and presentation, and the taste, was great! Definitely a cool place to grab a drink or a meal after shopping.
1	Great food, the lemon roll is my absolute favorite. Fantastic environment. Love that we sat at the bar and got to enjoy talking to the sushi chef. Limited wine but the food makes up for the lack of drink menu. Great experience:-)
1	Islands isn't just a restaurant...it's a lifestyle.  You can get anything here, from burgers and fries to soups and salads.  Great service and great food; who doesn't like that?  Islands is perfect for kids and adults!
1	Delicious. This was our first visit since Thai Rama has been closed and we were not disappointed.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Tom Kah soup was some of the best I've ever had and the lemon infused water was a nice touch. We also had the sweet and sour chicken which was kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. We will be back for sure.
1	BBQ salmon and seared ahi tuna steak were divine. The heirloom tomato salad was left wanting, the tomatoes were mealy and almost flavorless.  It wont stop us from continuing to come.  Oh, the lemondrop (I think it's called) martini is fantastic!  I don't drink anything that tastes like alcohol... I just don't like the taste, they were smooth (as smooth as anything lemon gets that is) and it was easy to drink more than one.
0	We  were seated immediately.  The tables were very small especially when we planned to cook our meal.we first ordered two sushi rolls they came Fer the meat had arrived.  The sushi was fair . The amount of meat we got for three was may be a pound of meat .The meat was  not well seasoned . . The ri bs were got was not edible because it was so chewy. The waitress forgot our order of tea.we were very disappointed
0	We got an email notice 24 hours before our concert date that it was cancelled -- no explanation, no help in getting tickets to other shows.We bought the tickets months in advance, and when we received the cancellation notice, it was really too late to get decent seats to another show. I'll never try to go see Celine in concert again.
1	Dr. Guarino is awesome!  He's knowledgable, friendly (very likeable), respectful and gave one of the best and easiest adjustments I have ever had. I felt better instantly. I am very particular and a bit fearful of chiropractors but Dr. Guarino is fantastic.  His office staff is great too...very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Backpro!!!
1	Had amazing pizza the New Yorker !! Meatballs are a must have ! And they serve Titos vodka  which makes it all that much better.  Defiantly a must got for lunch or dinner .
1	The drinks are good, the baristas are friendly and do a nice job. I love the staff. They make me smile every day!   The layout odd. No inside seating and limited outside seating.
1	My hubby and I were first timers to this place and it won't be the last time. The complementary chips and salsa and been dip is very yummy. We irdered chicken fajitas and they quick to the table and very good. Our waters were never empty the service was great. We had a server named John and he was so dedicated  about his work and you could tell. Super friendly and attentitive!
1	You cannot beat this hotel's accomodations and location for the price. I stayed for 3 nights at a rate of $41 per night. My room was clean and orderly. Television, internet connection, fridge worked. The rooms were fairly up to date.  I liked how they tried to be classy and equip the rooms with two mediocre bathrobes. I enjoyed the heated pool in the mornings, along with the bird chirping going on from the large bird cage nestled in the courtyard.
1	Delicious flavorful vegetarian restaurant the best I've had in phoenix. Prices are higher than most buy for all organic ingredients it's understandable. I would recommend this so long as you know it's 25 percent more than everywhere else.
0	The first time I went there a couple of years ago, it was pretty good.  Then I went there a year ago and it was ok.  Went again tonight and in my opinion, it was some of the worst  food I have ever had.    Like others have said, very inconsistent but either way, I won't be going back.
1	I loved this bar. It was beautifully laid out, could accommodate a large group of 8. It had only 2 kinds of Japanese scotch, but really how many do you need? There was no line when we arrived on a Saturday at 9, so that was good timing for us.  A beautiful atmosphere and I hope to return when I get back to Montreal.
1	I have been a member of Golds since February!  The staff at all locations are very helpful.   All locations have different machines!  I walk in it smells like a gym so I don't know what others say. If they don't like it go to private facilities.  I like it it's motivation to keep going!  50+ lbs down later and still going strong!  See you tomorrow!  And by the way their classes are awesome I love Zumba!  Helene and Michelle are great!
1	Stayed again 10/17/2014 Excellent check in by Bruce and our queen room was clean! I love this place!  Parking was a little rough later in the evening  and several work trucks made navigating the parking area difficult.  I would suggest to the management to have the larger vehicles park on the street. Checking out was quick and easy!
1	I took my car here after finding a big screw in one of my tires. They didn't charge anything to pull it out and patch the hole. I insisted on paying something but received a "I couldn't charge you with anything even if I wanted to."  Very friendly staff.  I was out the door in 20 minutes.
1	love this store,  im currently expecting and already purchased my babies bassinet,  crib with mattress and changing station for $250.  Maternity clothes is also very cute and affordable
1	Played here last week- was fun! Staff is super friendly and the proceeds went to a homeless shelter and soup kitchens. My hubby had never played bingo before but he enjoyed himself and wants to go back before we end our vacation
1	Delicious and I pretty much gorged myself on food, from the seafood appetizer platter (delicious, fresh oysters, shrimp, tuna tartare, crab, lobster conveniently de-shelled), bread & olive oil, and NY steak medium rare w/ a truffled potato gratin and sauteed spinach. Don't forget the dessert... Italian donuts, souffle, and little meringue cookies were unbelievable. Wine was superb as was the service.
1	My wife and I recently spent our Honeymoon in Edinburgh and our dining experience at Castle Terrace was hands down the best dining experience we have EVER had. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing. We had ordered the food tasting with the wine pairing. It was out of this world! We were in the restaurant for over 4 hours we were having such a good time! I can not recommend this restaurant enough if you are looking to splurge and celebrate.
1	I love this place 4am-9am haha So I tried it for dinner one night, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and really good quality.   Still a great after hours dive feel
0	I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!
1	Great food fast service..that's Chicago style at tasty dogs that what I got great place to eat...and if you where anything Chicago you get a discount very nice faces when you walk in. Many people miss that Chicago feel and great taste. Pictures on the wall represent the city and the culture well. If you ever in Vegas you have to stop by and grab a dog and dress it the way you want.
0	First time here , only thing nice about this place is the location. The food from the frozen baked wings , bland Mac and cheese , tasteless stuffed brisket burger , and let's not forget the pepperoni pizza that Sam's food club can do better . This has to be the worse bar food for game watching in Charlotte, NC .
1	I've had the pleasure of coming to this establishment since back in the days and it has never disappointed. Some of my favorites have always being the boca burger w a powerlift smoothie that always hits that special spot. Make sure to come by and give this little coffee pub a try because for me is being always a great treat.
1	The reverse happy hour is amazing! I love the food there and the drinks are also fantastic! Can't wait to go back for more drinks!
0	Wanted to find a sports bar to watch the 2nd half of the niners-pack game.  My expectations after perusing Yelp were pretty low.  Well it took our waitress about 15 mins to get me a beer.   Food came pretty slow as well.  My only positives are that the food was hot,  and the beer was cold.  Chicken strips were rubbery and potato skins were kinda greasy.  They could do better.  As I am new to the neighborhood, I am looking for a local sports bar and Tailgaters isn't looking like the place.
1	This is by far my favorite restaurant in town. It is extremely chic with very good looking waiters and waitress, def a ppl watching spot. btw, the pretty waiter/tresses are not the 'good looking but bitchy' kind. They are nice! :-) Excellent Italian & wine. They have an awesome wine cellar with an extensive list of wine from Italy. The wall of fame is truly fun to look at. That been said, you have to be happy to pay $16 + Tax for a small plate of salad to be a fan of this place.
1	This is my favorite spot in Vegas to stop for breakfast.  I'm the kind of guy who likes breakfast food at all times of the day.  Their skillets here are amazing, and so are their pancakes!  Highly recommend!
1	It seems every time I head west for either golf or coming back from LA, I like to stop off and grab a number 1. The burger always has fresh produce and the fries are one of the best.
1	My husband and I just returned from dinner at bootleggers & it was awesome! The brisket is one of the best we have ever tried, we even took an order to go! Highly recommend that as well as the apple moonshine. Our server, Marcus, was knowledgable and courteous. He deserves a raise ;) Thank you for a great experience and we will return.
1	Really good smoked meat sandwich. Here's my dilemma when it comes to delis... the sandwiches are made with a ridiculous amount of meat. seriously, who eats like that? so, i always have to take some out just so i can wrap my mouth around it. but then i have a pile of useless sandwich meat begging to be eaten.  Can i should i ask for more bread and eat the equivalent of 2 sandwiches? or do i just leave the sad pile of meat?  i usually do the former followed by a trip to the drugstore for some alka-seltzer.
1	Above-average United Club, 3rd Level, Terminal 3. Pluses:  * Open almost 24 hours:  4:30 to after midnight to serve the Red Eye flights * Friendly, helpful staff including Front Desk and Bartenders * Clean, modern facility with comfortable seating and abundant A/C outlets * Even serves bourbon as well-drink...missing in most United Clubs Negatives:  A Modest Suggestion...United would do well to study Lufthansa Lounges how to set up and operate a true hospitality lounge.
0	I was price  shopping and  for  $59 a  night,   it was over priced and out  of class  for that price. it rates a  5  outta  10 star's   and price  should be knocked  down to $35  a  nite. the hindu  clerk  does not have command of the English language, nor  could he answer  simple  questions....a.k.a..  locations  of things.
1	What a great place! I walked right in was greeted at the door. We told them it was our first time here. I was offered a beer and a seat. Their hummus was home made and awesome. Everyone here was super attentive and very nice. Just an all around good night. Will for sure be back.
0	It was very tasty, but the resulting food poisoning makes me never want to eat there again. The last thing I wanted for my birthday was to be stuck in my hotel for 2 days throwing up.
1	I have been in the LV  since December 2013, and I still love this station! My wish is that really dig into the crates and play some stuff that hasn't been heard in a long while! Examples: slave, New birth, I heard a kc and the sunshine band song that noone played in ages and I heard it on 88.1. Yes, I have discovered the other station! I still love this station but Tuesday and Thursday is 88.1. I know you guys can step it up.
1	The atmosphere and staff were just okay.  My drink was pretty weak but my girlfriend loved hers.  However, the food was much better than than either of us expected;  better than the Michelin rated place we went to the next night.
0	Came in Saturday, a little after 5:00, very few customers and plenty of staff. We sat for several long minutes before they finally figured out who would serve us. The food came quickly, and was hot but just adequate. The lobster ravioli tasty fishy and the chicken was dry. It had been a long time since we had been to a Macaroni Grill. We see no reason to rush back.
1	Dr. Rebecca at Renaissance is one of my favorites ever.  I've been going to her for the past month and I cannot believe the improvement in my back pain.  Also, she has Dennis and I getting more exercise, eating better, and sleeping better, too! If you want a great experience with a chiro who will give you the straight facts, go see Dr. Rebecca!  Her prices are super reasonable and she accepts all kinds of insurance. And no, she has not paid me for this endorsement. :)
1	Been coming here every Tuesday with the family for 2 years know always drive through . Fried chicken mild just the skin will make your knees buckle. Chicken always perfection juicier then a gallon of Tampico and seasoned to make you eat till you go into a fried chicken coma.... 2 pieces of fried chicken for .99¢ can't beat it!
0	I sampled a number of dishes including shrimp cocktail, a spinach salad with goat cheese, skirt steak, Chinese broccoli, sweet potato mash, a bbq rib, and 3 desserts.  Everything was fresh looking, but each dish seemed to be aimed at not offending rather than titillating one's taste buds. A rating of 2.5 would be appropriate.
1	Just a quick update----La Scena is no longer there. Well, the venue itself is there but the name "La Scena" is no more. I forget the new name, but it's based upon the "Rock of Ages" show I think. Same bar, same live band area, etc--but a different name.
1	Hobby Lobby is my drug of choice. I basically decorated my home with 90% Hobby Lobby. The staff is always friendly, they have great deals, its clean, and its really large.
1	Great course for beginners. It's not anything special and isn't kept up very well, but it's a good place to practice and a great course to walk.
1	if it had been any less like the original i would have been sad. granted i'm not totally into jazz. ( i know. i'm a monster) but if you go there on an off night it's a really nice place to go to with a date followed up with of course their black and white picture booth so you can remember the night forever. :) isn't that romantic?
1	A fan of the ambience and fact you don't ever have to wait for a table. Lots of vegetarian options. And love the chocolate lava cake. Inside Palms Hotel.
0	I have never had such a poor customer experience in any grocery store to date.  The store staff couldn't care less about assisting customers.  The assistant manager wouldn't allow me to voice concerns and just kept saying how sorry he was.  I think I will drive out of my way to another grocery store.
0	The company is a rouse!  Mike Ferry pays his sales staff a little above minimum wage...hourly.Some of these individuals have backgrounds like waitressing and internet gambling. Less than one percent are college educated!  Many clients request to get out of their coaching contracts because it DOES NOT WORK!!  It is a TOTALLY unprofessional business environment with male members of the call center sales team making BLATANT lude and sexual comments. As a result, a formal complaint has been made with the EEO.
1	I would eat here even if it wasn't in an airport.  Food was well above average for an airport restaurant, definitely a must when in Charlotte on a layover.
1	Love love love this place! Honest mechanics honest owners. I feel like family every time I come here to get my car serviced. The mechanics communicate clearly to you about your car so that you feel at ease and understand what's going on. I recommend everyone I know to them.
0	Poor service at the deck pool! Paid $10 to get in as locals and waited over 30 mins for anyone to see if we wanted food or drinks. We asked for a menu and no one ever came back to take our order. The pool could use more water so all the jets are not spraying water across the pool. Hope for better service at The Salted Lime for dinner cause starving after no service at the pool.
1	We needed some sandblasting on some exterior walls.  I called baja sandblasting and in the same day they came out gave me a very fair quote and did the sandblasting right then. They did an amazing job!!! Very very happy w them. I just called them back to schedule them to do some interior walls.
0	Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all.
1	Great atmosphere, solid ambiance, excellent service, tasty drink selection and a dinner menu to die for. Try the Calabrese Piazzo, perfect spice, sweet chillies, three cheeses and spicy sausage.
0	I ate here for lunch and unfortunately the food took a while to be served.  The prices seemed high for lunch time and they didn't really have a lunch menu.  I ordered an Italian sandwich and I received something that really didn't resemble a sandwich at all.  Most likely not coming back anytime soon.
0	this place has a lot of misleading reviews,to be honest I did not like the menu and the idea of someone else making a menu for me with a few questions and then charge a person $30-50. Over priced!  The place was cool but seen better places with better food. I suggest those who wants to try this place to look @ their menu and think twice about spending $$$ on a small portion of food.
0	Dear Hot N Juicy, I am SO sorry that I ever cheated on you...what a BIG MISTAKE I've made.  P.S.   Food = Meh.... Service = They are good at charging things wrong and serving appetizers, entrees and sides out of order.
0	Besides being directed to a table that we expressed disapproval (which they would not change despite no one siting in other tables during our stay), the food, although good, was very expensive for the quality and quantity.  The ambiance was dreadful in the hallway that we were sat.  As diligent restaurant goers, we expressed our concerns to the manager who was less than receptive and offered no remedies.
1	BBQ was AWESOME!  Wait us usually long, plan about an hour to get seated. They start taking names at 3, opens at 4pm. Seating area is small, booths good for parties of 2-4. 21+ only! For Club members 12.99 gets you a rack of ribs, corn on the cob, beans and cole slaw! What could be better! Ribs were meaty! BBQ was great! Micro Brew beers were $2!! Totally worth the wait! Definitely will be back next time I am in town!!
1	Great lounge experience. Door staff and cocktail waitresses were really nice. We got VIP seating and two bottles for the price of one. Fun place with good music and nice vibe. Definitely recommend getting bottles and a table if you wanna have a home base to sit and rest your feet after lots of dancing!
1	I come here once a month to get my nails done.  While Friday evenings and Saturdays are impossible to get in on, I've never had to wait longer then 30 minutes. It's tucked away at the end of a strip mall, but such a great find!
0	So far crap! Can't check-in until 4 unless we want a full bed. Then tried to check-in at 4 and told all they had was a handicapped accessible room with a double bed. Said needed to wait another 40 minutes. Smells like smoke in the empty lobby where they are supposedly full! Do not book via Priceline!
1	I had an appointment in Old Town and I was hungry, so I wanted a place that would be fast enough without resorting to fast food.  I remembered this little place next to Daily Dose, so I decided to check it out.  The ladies working there were very nice and welcoming.  I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich.  It was very tasty and had a bit of a kick.  I can't wait to taste the crepes.
0	Is this place still open? Their website has been down all week, and no one is returning my messages. We wanted to sign our child up after hearing such good things.
1	The most amazing burgers that I have ever had in Canada but the place doesn't match right.  The look of the place and music doesn't match the menu. It's hard to describe but the burgers and fries are still amazing. I only give this place 4/5 not 5/5 because it is a little pricy for just burgers and the fries are an addition. Hamburger and fries are suppose to come as a package.
0	They changed the price to double the amount. Yet the work they are to preform has not changed. They are only trying to make a fast buck off of you. If they can double the price they will. I am filing a complaint with the Nevada State board of Dental Examiners here is a link  http://www.nvdentalboard.nv.gov/Licensees.htm I have also informed my dental plan that they be over charging for the work. I only give them one star because it seems that the work they have done is ok.
0	Picky buyers, not a huge selection, and because this is not in a good neighborhood, homeless people have been known to wander in and ask for money. Other locations definitely offer cleaner stores in better areas.
0	Wait staff was attentive but the food was very bland. Nuts in the Kung Pao Chicken looked like they came straight from a Planters jar. Place has potential but they need to step it up a bunch in my book
1	I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience.
1	I love this hotel....  Rooms are big and clean, friendly staff , and a very affordable prices ... The neighborhood not so good but o well, public transportation outside of the casino. Overall a nice place to stay while u in vegas.
1	Man I love this place! Awesome service, quick seating, and great wings of course. I usually go out of my way to go to this Buffalo Wild Wings location! You wont be disappointed!
0	Honestly, I have enjoyed this place many times in the past...but tonight had a horrible experience. The place was busy but shouldn't be an excuse for bad customer service. Also my first order was lost amd finally came the salmon was terrible...I actually spit it out on my plate. I hope this is not the new standard.
1	I came to dinner here with a friend and sat at the bar. The Bartender was very welcoming and made excellent drinks!! We came for happy hour and after agreeing on 3 food items, the bartender had the order in before we even told him!! Great ears!!  Couldn't have asked for better service was excellent and the food was just as good! We will definitely be back!!
0	The sushi here is fine but nothing special. I placed an order for pick up. I had looked up the menu on two different websites. I ordered three roles to share with my husband and it was suppose to total $20. When I got there it was $28. When I told them that the prices online were different they just said they changed the menu recently. I asked if they had a menu I could take with me they said no. I don't think we will be back. There are better sushi places for the same price.
0	Horrible! Their website said they were open on Sunday. The sign on the door said they were open at 11 am. We got there at about 10:45 and waited in the front for them to open. Instead we waited until 12 thinking they were just late but nope! They weren't even open! Went to eat ruby rouge dim sum nearby! Great place to eat! I recommend that!
1	A surprise small market with good produce. The blueberries here are great and cheap. You might want to check their chocolate section. ..locally made.
0	Seriousley, I do not understand how they get 4 to 5 star review from customer.  This restaurant is not even own by Japanese owner.  I am Japanese and tast of fish was ok.  I visited this place because of a good rating, but I guess I was spoiled grow up in Japan and live in CA for many years.   I do not recommended to eat sushi or even some Japanese food at this place.
1	Live music was really good. Food was tasty. I mean besides all the other stuff Vegas offered this was a good stop on the way out for an evening on the strip.
1	St. Cathrine had me majorly bummed out by the scene. Shopping trendy stores is not my deal. So I was really excited when I saw that familiar Lush sign. It means friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff, and wonderful smells! II bought a bath bomb to clear away the "hotel" smell of my room, and got some great samples.
0	Whose **** do I need to suck to get a drink around here ? Oh joy. The owner's. The tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed. When they aren't being molested by their boss they may have time to service you. This is too painful a scene, which could very well lead to more drinking.. Fortunately, I have money to purchase a drink, so Ill be at Hideaway West.
1	I've never been so I'm giving benefit of doubt I'm gonna love it. I read the few reviews on here and saw pics . I'd like to get a run in sometime this morning when it warms up at bit. Ready for beautiful outdoor scenery versus treadmill at gym (not that there isn't great scenery there *wink. Hope to get a good runners high, set the mood for today. I will rewrite review if it turns out great or not so great.
0	Didn't even get in. After Steeler game on Sat Night . Went there to get drinks and maybe apps.  We went in. Door guy on 12-3-15 said our friend had a ski like pants on and said his pants were not proper entire.  Said if he stripped to next layer of jeans or kakky's. He was.  Good. Not. We left went to next pub spent 200$.   f u a hole door guy you suck!
0	This place is bull s#%£ I had an appointment at 12:00 and now it is 1:00 and I'm still waiting. We have asked them how much longer 3 times and they keep saying your next and now 7 people have gone back. Avoid this place if you can.
0	A short review: Want to know what their burgers taste like?  Go to Jack in the Box, and order an Ultimate Cheeseburger.  That's what it tastes like.  The fries are similar to those at Teddy's Bigger Burger.   Disappointing.  In n Out is most certainly better.
0	We had our company Christmas Party there.  Before closing, the staff turned the lights out over half our table.  The darkness was so overwelming, that we all forgot what we were even talking about.  When we were leaving our ruined party, we spoke to the staff about this.  They responded that "we all have families to go home to."  They don't care about their customers' experiences there.  I will never go there again.  Not even an "I'm sorry!" from them.
0	Waited over 30 minutes because they kept on taking their friends that walked in after us, finally walked out. This has happened several times. We no longer go there.
1	The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere. They have happy hour from 5-8 pm, you can actually try different Brazilian appetizer as their menu is pretty decent. You can also have all you can eat salad bar or all you can ate meats. their food is pretty tasty. I still prefer Texas de Brazil but If you don't want to drive far this place is a good option.
1	we were very pleased. The ambiance was warm, the service was fantastic. Sergio, our waiter was attentive and friendly. The food was fabulous. Would recommend to anyone! Very well done!
0	The only positive thing to say about our experience here was that we didn't have to wait for a table.... Now we know why.  The food was terrible and the service was worse.  Sat in the bar area and as a special treat had the staff there eating with us complaining about the food right in front of us.  Management was no where to be found either. What a mess. Don't waste your money here there are too many great restaurants in the Southpark area
1	I used to have to wine and dine customers and would always take them to Mucho Gusto.The food is a fancy twist on traditional Mexican food and the quality is amazing. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the service is kind of slow. I would recommend for sure.
1	I always sit at the bar.  Kim or Pam, not sure about name, she's so great.  Good recommendations.  Love the short rib taco platter.  Comes with corn tortilla, guacamole, salsa.  The ahi taco is good too. But my soul food go to is the short rib.  So glad they opened a branch at the airport. Food comes out fast!
1	Yes, this place is super cool.  Super tiny; but super cool.  Try not to go with a large group or the seating will be awkward.  Their menu is really awesome -- more a lunch-type menu with sandwiches and soups.  If I remember correctly, they had a seafood soup that was only served on Fridays and it was delicious! You can get a really decent meal with smoothie and all for around $10.  Their servers are cool and the decor is so very Montreal.
0	My girlfriend and I decided to eat there before leaving sin city. Seeing 4 stars on yelp, we thought that we were gonna enjoy good Italian food.  She had the veal milanese and I had the spaghetti meatball. My question is why 4 stars ? Has anyone ever tried Italian food ??? I only give 2 star because our server was good. The food is really basic and is definitely not worth the price.  My girl said that this place should had been in the food court along with burger king.
0	HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  wow nothing good to say at all about this dump. Ordered a dinner dish. A ceaser salad and spaghetti. They gave me iceberg lettuce (crap) with a side of ceaser dressing. About 30 minutes later my meal comes out.  Sauce was cold.. Ten min later they finally bring it back...ABSOLUTE garbage for being in seven hiLLS. OH and you get to see the employees smoke cigs outside while your eating right in front of them. Its all can good food..i'd rather eat at pizza hut or cicis
1	Great burger & shake & fries inside of Harrah's where we stayed. It was ridiculous prices, but thats Vegas I guess. For one burger, fries & a shake it was almost $30. The burger was damn good though and thick. It was a chimmichurri burger and then the shake was Neapolitan. Very very good. The server was nice, dressed like an outrageous gay dude but thats Vegas too.
0	I just left there with a couple of my friends. It was unbelievable they said that their computer went down so they messed up our order . Honestly people who came way after us got their order . We kept on reminding them but all they gave us was were working on it. After an hour of waiting for noodles, we decided to pay for our drinks  and appetizers and leave . Can you imagine being hungry, cold, and ignored. Sorry but I am going back to Shoyu where you're always welcome and appreciated.
1	Best prime rib for reasonable price. They brew beer in house,  very tasty Small casino , you might come across some shady people but who cares as long as you mind your business.  Garage parking is bit crazy ... narrow turns .  Just one rest room for whole casino floor , you need to do some across the floor. Not super clean but bearable .
1	Best buffet I have ever been to!! We'll worth the $40 person. All you can drink beer and wine and my boyfriend loved that. The food was excellent. Tons of variety and every type of meat u can imagine. The crab legs and shrimp we're delicious! Highly recommend and I will definitely be going back
1	Prices are competitive within the South Hills area for nail salons...maybe even a little bit cheaper. They are clean and you never have to wait for a walk-in appt.
0	First time very good experices second worst waiter I have ever meet!! He rolled his eyes every time I try to get his attention and when I let another staff member know she quickly talked to him but this person would not even offer to take the plates or nither refill my coke (not that I would after complaining) one bad employee makes you have seconds toughs about going back.. P.S Sushi is not even worth it
0	Wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks. Just cancelled and move to Fitness Connection for $10 bucks a month. For that price I can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the Y. This place is seriously over sold. Stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members. Serious over crowding issue.
0	Went there for my birthday brunch because I had read some good reviews so I thought it would be good.  Man was I wrong. The food to forever to get there the wait staff ignored us the whole time.  The food was cold the pancakes where stale and hard. The coffee was even bad. The worst part is when we complained they didn't even ask if we wanted the food remade or seemed to even care about the quality of the food.  Don't waist your time with this place.
1	I recently purchased a 2012 Dodge Ram Laramie Limited from Prestige and i must say every step of it was amazing!!!!  i have purchased several vehicles with this company and everyone has been great and super easy. Tino and Rennie are the best if you ever need a new car ask for them !!!!!!
0	The worse eyelash ever!!!!!!!! Stayed there to finish for 2 hours, after she is done, my eyes was so uncomfortable, but she couldn't help me to fix. I was so sad because I even couldn't open my eyes. After a while, another one to help me to fix But still felt something in my eyes.. After I went home, I couldn't stop to touch my eyes until every eyelash is gone.. Tooo bad.. Even my real eyelash is gone.. The sad day ever!!!!'
0	Wouldn't honor their free smoothie promotion because THEIR system wasn't working properly. A sign was posted that if I texted a number I'd receive a free smoothie. I did NOT receive a free smoothie. I hope it's the cashier's first day because he didn't even seem like he knew where he was.
1	Rarely give a 5 star rating. This steakhouse had superb food. Excellent service, great ambiance, and awesome steaks! Our whole experience was excellent (once we got past the snooty little girls who seated us)     Our waiter and his fellow staff were first class. The mixed appetizers and entrées were some of the very best I have ever eaten.  Their beef was cooked perfectly to our requests, the side dishes all of a very high standard. When back in Vegas, will be dining there again!
0	Horrible!!! I ordered the gyro, the meat was  frozen strips of who knows what! I took one bite and  had to spit it out. The owner took my order and said 10 minutes but it was more like 30. The owner and his wife appeared to be having a heated argument while he was cooking. I wish I could say something positive about the place, but there really isn't anything.
0	Food was decent. Waiter was attentive. Music was a bit loud and I did not appreciate the people smoking cigars while I ate. I am sure its because they were "making it rain" on the band performing. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it weren't for the cigar and cigarette smoke, which I think is against health code now. Probably won't go back unless it is to-go.
1	I ordered 5 large pizzas for a party I had last weekend and they were great.  I popped in early in the day and placed my order.  The pizzas were hot and ready on time.  We got a variety of pizzas and they were really good.  The spicy chicken pesto was the biggest hit.  Totally perfect for the party.  All my friends were asking about the place I ordered from.  They have awesome wings too.  Plus, everyone that works there is so nice... the type of neighborhood place you always want to order from.
1	I brought my bike in, and within 10 minutes they had me out the door with a new tire. Very knowledgeable staff! The food is delicious as well.
0	Normally my family has had very good luck at Smart and Final.  However this time after purchasing a 17.5 lbs of Tri-tips I got home and started getting them ready for the next days grilling and literally trimmed of over 5 lbs of fat.  This is totally unacceptable.  Not  sure what to think, I understand there is going to be a fat cap but 5lbs is very excessive.   See photo's.
1	Great experience at Green Valley Range.  Very friendly folks and our instructor was very professional and helpful.  Highly recommend.
0	Awful. Went with 6 other goodies and it was a joke. Service, food, timing...no. Spend your $ at Guy Savoy or Picasso if you're in LV.
1	Not having had a real haircut in years I was incredibly apprehensive about going, but Karen did a fantabulous job. I look 15 years younger and feel like I need to buy new clothes to match my wonderful hair!! The only minor complaint I have is the window says walk-ins are welcome, but no one was available until an hour later. If I didn't live so close, that may have prevented me from returning. What a travesty that would have been!!
1	This is one of my regular spots - good, everyday sushi at a decent price. Go during happy hour, 2 to 5 for their best deal. I go at least once a week to get my sushi fix. I like making my own roll selections though I have tried the menu items. It's very nice that they don't charge extra for brown rice. It's not gourmet sushi but it is good and if you want sushi as often as I do, this is a great place to get it.
0	Great outdoor patio...but that is about it.  Went last night and the highlight of my meal was the cheese on the nacho appetizer.  I tried their signature margarita chicken dish...what a disappointment that was....had no taste and wasn't hot.
1	I purchased a Groupon and was very pleased with this experience!  The manager gives a VERY aggressive scalp massage and Delia styled my hair beautifully.  The BEST part...my hair was light, bouncy, silky and stayed pretty for 3 days!!!!
0	Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.
0	I'm very confused why people think this is the best grocery store in Vegas.  I am consistently annoyed when coming here because while they carry kitschy items that most other stores don't carry, they don't carry many normal things, like a variety of tomato sauces, pickles or olives.  They also don't have a very good organic produce section.   I would much rather pay more and go across the street to Von's than be frustrated going into this store.
1	In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. I hit this Buffet at least twice when I stay. One of the best Buffets on the strip. It has every ethnic culture covered, one of the best chefs working and for what you pay is $$$, it's still a good deal. One of the most do things when in Vegas.
0	Way overpriced. Just go to Grand Lux for a cheaper, tastier, larger burger. Enough said. I would equate the burgers at I heart burgers to the quality of five guys or smashburger, except I heart burgers cost like 3-4X the amount.
1	I took my nieces in for a sweet treat and they loved it! The place is truly charming and clean. The pastries and our coffee were delicious. The staff was very attentive and patient. We were surprised, by the owner I believe, with complimentary samples of the gelato and it was truly amazing! Nice touch and very thankful for the sweet treat. Looking forward to going again!
1	I thought this place was awesome. I'd go there even if I wasn't staying at the Mirage. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time and the food is cheap and you can't seem to go wrong with anything on the menu. They have a decent drink selection and it's a convenient location right by the entrance in the Mirage. Highly recommended for something casual, stomach filling ,and fast.
0	The atmosphere was amazing. The sushi was fresh but lacked pizzaz and taste. My order was incorrect and the waitress was busy so i ended up just shutting my mouth. The bathroom was disgusting. The price was decent .. happy hour prices. I wont be back. Major dissapointment.
0	Good presentation, good marketing and a trendy decor? Check check and check. Good poutine...?  I'm a Montrealer who spent a year in Toronto, where Smoke's is -the- place to get pout. Quality high, and authentic. When I heard one had opened in Montreal, I encouraged a group of friends to check it out with me. The end result? Really average poutine and half of us getting violent food poisoning. Avoid.
1	Took a motorcycle ride today, ended up out by the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant (oooh, aaah) and landed at the Tin Top Bar & Grill for lunch and beverages!  Um, YUM. Had a most excellent chicken-fried steak sandwhich, nicely put together with just enough fries to make it a good lunch!  Good Service, Cold Beer, Good selections on the Menu.  Too Bad its about 80 milles from our house.
1	I recently needed a repair on my A/C.  He gave me a reasonable estimate and did a thorough check to make sure everything was okay.  Great friendly service.  I was also having the house painted at the time.  He also called later to make sure I turned off the A/C before the painters started spraying the house.
1	When I visit new restaurants for the first time, I typically find one or two things that make it less than a five star experience. In this case, I could find no flaw. One of my fellow diners made a special request which they did without question. I had the cheese burger and fries. It was fantastic. All who dined with me for lunch enjoyed their food. It was a great atmosphere and they have free wifi which was needed for the meeting we were having there. Definitely worth a visit!
0	Most UNAUTHENTIC spanish restaurant I've ever been to.  Stopped in for a drink and tapas and left after the drink.  The whole ambiance just isn't there. Based on other reviews, I'm pretty sure I didn't miss out on a whole lot.
0	Decor was beautiful. Service was spotty but friendly. Food was surprisingly bland (fillet Mignon, calamari, prawns & sauteed mushrooms.) Spent $89. Maybe it was an off day. Received a nice apology from management on line after review.
1	Delicious, delicious, delicious...from the wine, to the bread and garlic butter...the entrees and on to the desserts! Nice atmosphere and great service as well. This is a must go to restaurant!
0	This place tries to be like the old Mick's chain in Atlanta - an Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday, but with fresh food, executed well. Unfortunately, the food's just not that good. The Italian meatloaf isn't awful, but it's nothing to write home about. The apps were decent, but not great. My GF loves their black bean burger, though (and it IS pretty good for a non-meat burger). It's a good place to watch a game,but not as a dining destination.
1	At my first visit this month, Dr. Radke and her assistants were wonderful. I never had to wait long and most importantly, Radke really addressed my eye allergies (a new phenomenon for me as a recent Wisco resident) and pointed me toward some new contacts that are AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE! I really like that they offer Optomap as an alternative to dilating your eyes. It isn't covered under insurance but the cost is well worth avoiding dilation eye drops in my book.
1	Henry Morales is an awesone employee. Every time I come here and he's here he's always in good spirits and makes my meal enjoyable. The salad bar is always clean and stocked well. Other employees make sure tables are clean and make sure they're attended to as soon as customers leave or before they sit down. Plus free softserve after a meal is always great.
0	I walk in, smile and say hi. Lady at the front ignores me and walks away. New lady takes my order but the chef decides he's gonna have a 5 min conversation with the first lady before he prepares my food. Too many better options out there.
1	Ice cream cookie sandwiches, sorbet, and smoothies late at night? What an awesome idea! The guy in the store was super nice and this place just makes me jealous of Tempe.
1	I had great service at the Tempe Marketplace Cox retail store today. I had to drop off my dvr and change my phone service so I drove down to the Cox store. As I entered there was a service representative there to greet me. He took the dvr, walked over to the counter and made the changes in immediately. I think that I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The representative was both courteous and efficient.
1	Vic did a great job hooking up our existing home surround system. He even came back to connect our amp that we ended up adding to our receiver and subwoofer. Now it's like we got a mini home theatre! Thanks.
1	Awesome place our kickball team goes here almost every Monday.. The staff is always nice and friendly and food and drinks are fast.. There prices are great. Love this place cant wait till next week for more...:)
0	Never again will I go to the Zoyos on Gilbert and Brown. I was humiliated when I was turned down  for the third time on pajamas night ,Laughfing at me saying "thats not P.J's " and did not get the 50% off, I think that is VERY rude!!
0	The waitress couldn't tell me which Shock Top they had on tap, and didn't know that a mudslide isn't always a frozen drink. And thanks place only takes cash. Fuck this place.
0	Was here yesterday and the service was beyond slow... my food order was wrong.... TWICE! The girl that took my order was nice, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place. The food was.... forgettable...  I would've been better off going to McDonalds and saving myself a couple bucks. The service and the food is just not worth it.
1	Came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. The oxtail cheese fries were crazy and delicious and the burgers (Miyagi and a custom) were killer. The craft beer list was very strong and the staff was knowledgeable.
1	So delicious and I spent way less than I thought I would! Such a great idea for a sushi place. The service people aren't great though, kind of rude but I'll definitely comeback because of the food and prices.
0	I could go on and on, but since this isn't the place for a "rant"-- I'll get straight to the point... If you enjoy difficulties getting an appointment, waiting 40 minutes to an hour, and want to worry about how many minutes you are in the room with the doctor (because you will be charged approximately $200 extra if she decides to chit chat), then Siena Pediatrics is the place for you!
1	Great place for just hanging out with friends over a drink and grabbing a burger!  Sunday/Tuesday night burger night is the best!
1	I LOVE The Loft. I've been going to my hair dresser, Kristine Forner, for the past 4 years and she ended up here a couple years ago. Everyone is friendly and they offer my favorite hair products. Bumble and Bumble! I would definitely recommend coming here to get your hair did. I also had Dawna Buckroff do my hair in a pin up style and she did an awesome job.  Two thumbs up!
0	By far the worst manicure pedicure I have ever received. They rough, rude and provide low grade services. I actually need to file my nails to be even and my gel manicure was globbed on. Better luck doing your own nails.
0	Had the worst experience eating at this restaurant. Cashier in front gave us the worst attitude.  I used to come to this restaurant every time I come to Las Vegas, I will not go any more.
1	This is a place I usually like to go since you can find some areas where dialogues are possible (i.e. the noise level is low in some spots). Although it is a bit pricey, I enjoy being able to lounge a little either upstairs or downstairs.
1	Love this place!!!   It is so small and dark and quaint!!!  Huge wine selection...and that bruschetta ......Yum! I didn't really need to add my review because there are so many and most agree that is place is great. My favorite thing about Postino is on Mon and Tue nights .....you can buy a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 ..plenty for two! Parking can be hard around here...but they offer valet for $3..
0	Sales is a joke. If there is one thing I hate most, it is liars.  Lost a sale but oh well... Ended up purchasing from BMW of Las Vegas.  Thank you BMW of Las Vegas for not BULLSHITTING.
1	I have been a patient of Dr. Pollock for years maybe now. I only see him once a year but he reminders details from conversations we had during my last appointment as though we just left off. He's very friendly and helps put you at ease. I highly recommend him to others. I moved across town but am happy to travel a little further to continue to have him as my doctor.
1	The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but be patient because the wings are worth it! The sauces were great, not too hot but enough to give a good kick. Everything is made fresh so it takes some time, don't expect to be in a hurry at ATL. The wings are meaty and the sides are great! It is worth the trip to Chandler.
1	For excellent local food I suggest Po'Boys. Their pizza is great (if you are a fan of deep dish, then this is not the place for you). I would say their smoked chicken, polish sausage and rib tips are great! Parking is easy and they have beer, wine and spirits.
0	I don't like Sushi, so I was doomed from the minute I walked through the door here. I asked the waiter what is the best thing to have for a first-time sushi experience,... he laughed in my face and told me I was in the wrong place. How rude!! My brothers loved the sushi, they actually like it, I hated it. I left feeling hungry and cheated. It's a nice place, but just not my cup of tea.
0	Was nice for awhile but lately, on weeknights, the vibe has been dragging. And the music played over the soundsystem has been odd, if considered music at all. I guess most people wear headphones anyway but would be cool to have a better vibe with some type of subscription music played overhead.
0	Close this store because they never have chicken! You order three wings they have 2 ready, you order beast dinner they have nothing but thighs. I guess they do have chicken but never what I order.
0	This is a large facility with major conference facilities attached. The rooms are *VERY* dated and in serious need for maintenance work. The beds are OK, but the rest of the room is old, out of style, ... the bathrooms had plumbing issues. The airport shuttle was slow. They have a great location and the potential to be OK, but they do not even seen to be trying.
1	I love this place! The staff is very friendly and helpful. My lash artist, Chantel, is AMAZING! I have been a loyal customer for nearly a year now and would recommend it to everyone. Go get a free consultation! It will change your life...just a word of caution: be prepared for constant compliments on your lashes! :)
1	Lucille's Smokehouse kids ribs are awesome! Good deal and good taste. Service could have been better but the food was awesome. I would have given 5 stars but the prices could be lower! Great food, sub par service.  I'm from the south and this is the closet southern BBQ I've had since I've live in Phoenix, AZ.
0	If there was a Zero star that's what this place would have gotten overly priced for just ground beef and the fry bread alone $6.50 no cheese,lettuce etc. They must don't know their competition here in Phoenix like White Eyes FryBread where you get any topping added to your choice of meat for $6. The cinammon honey sugar FryBread was bland! Was in booth less than 3 mins after receiving food... Starving still and disappointed! Don't trust other reviews I did coming from N.Phoenix
1	We have had August out to help us with our pool twice now and I am very impressed with him. He's smart, knowledgeable, honest, and affordable. The first time he fixed a broken connector on the pump and the second time he got our in-floor cleaning system working again. It cost us under $50 each time. I highly recommend this guy. I found him here on Yelp.
1	I'd been here a few times.  I love where it's located in the Madison Square.  I love eating and people watching.  The food is always great and the service is always topnotch. We had the Sausage Pizza and the homemade spaghetti. It was one of the best I have ever had.
1	Food.  Awesome.  Service.  Awesome (Patty).  Ambience.  Awesome. Temperature.  SUCKED!  I froze through half my meal.  When I mentioned it to Patty, she said it happens at that part of the rotation.  For $80 a head (at least!)  you'd think they could take care of that!
1	Great BBQ, and really nice people too!  One of the best BBQ places in town and not a dump like some of the other good places too!
1	Die Falafeln hier sind einfach hervorragend und super spitze, ich gehe oft in der Mittagspause hin und das ist immer richtig gut. Zudem wird man fast immer mit Freundlichkeit bedient.
1	I ordered four tapas & seafood paella. Other two friends and I shared all of them. The tapas were all fabulous, especially black rice which is with squid ink. The other three are salmon & truffle, octopus, and lobster & saffron. But seafood paella did not reach my expectation, cuz I did like the rice inside, however the prawn really nice!
0	Don't sit next to the fountain unless you want to yell your entire meal. This ruined most of our night, but the food wasn't bad. Large portions though. Right in the middle of the Casar Forum.
0	The food was ok, but far from great. There were a few items that I really liked, but there were far more that let me down.  Service was horrible. Dirty plates piled up and it was impossible to get water or champagne refills. I would expect this type of service at a $8 buffet, but when the bill is $45 a head I expect a little more.
0	Absolutely terrible. All hype, no delivery. Meat was dry and bland, service was rude, don't know why people would wait over an hour for a sandwich that deserves zero recognition. AVOID - and thank me later
1	The food was pretty amazing for the price and Omar was a very friendly, helpful server!  We ate until we were stuffed for $22, we'll definitely be back.
0	I liked the decor, but the place was fairly empty on a Friday evening so it lacked vibrancy. The service was friendly but a little on the slow side. There were 7 of us in our group.  I thought the food was mediocre.  I had the Vegetarian Plate and I have had a lot better.  The tomato sauce tasted canned.  A fresh tomato salsa would have added a sparkle to the otherwise boring dish.  My guests enjoyed the shrimp. The prices seemed high for what we got.
1	Fabulous all the way around!  Ambiance feels authentic like you have just walked in an old Irish pub! Complete with live music! Ordered a salad fresh quality and different in a good way!   Best soup ever is the Colcannon soup! OMG I will be craving this the rest of my life! Fabulous service and laid back crowd!
0	Wow... The owner has real guts to call his restaurant as "Indian restaurant"... It taste nowhere close to food... Every thing is frozen... Do not recommend...
0	mh did this the last time i went to vegas in january.. i love the show so i was hoping for either a three d thing or something ANYTHING would've been better than this. walking around here and there and looking at stuff... not worth the money............not worth the time........
1	Loves it! Ate here twice during a 5 night stay at Mandalay Bay. First time they were packed but offered seating at the milkshake bar - where we received amazing service.  The burgers are delicious and the service is awesome! Well worth the money!
1	Ok I am going to give this a 5 star review the food was over the top! The shakes were incredible , they made to order burgers for us which was great, even the Ice Tea for this southern boy was increbile.   The sauces that pair with the onion rings fries and sweet potatoes fries are paired well. The only thing is you have 30 beer taps and only one dark beer on tap come on GR at least change that.  Will definitely come back again
0	First time ordered a large 2 topping thin crust pizza and wings. Pizza very bland, too much sauce. Mushrooms you could tell were  from a can or jar and placed under the cheese. Wings hardly had any flavor or sauce for being medium, ranch was watered down.
1	Not Only do they make the absolute best donuts and pastries in the whole metro area the couple that own and run the business exemplify the meaning of American small business !!   Go there now. Spend all your money!!!!  Be happy all day!!!!!!
0	I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
0	I will NEVER go back to Soyo.  The food actually was not that bad.  However the service was deplorable.  They just don't seem to care. We even had Korean speaking people at our table and their lunch was ruined because of the service.
1	The pizza here is pretty good!  They also have a pretty good beer selection including local drafts, which is cool. We got a Greek salad for our app and it was ok...not the best, but it wasn't bad either. I ordered the sausage/broccoli rabe pizza and it was really good.  The crust was super thin and perfect. My husband usually throws his crusts away, but even he ate his!  He ordered the mushroom pizza and loved it - I'm not a huge mushroom fan, so I didn't have any of his. We'll definitely be back here!
1	Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it's hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone, it's nice to walk into one every once in a while.
1	I love this place, first it's like a Palestinian deli in NYC, they have freshly made salads, hummus, also Cornish hen, and THR portions a HUGE...so you need to be hungry! The food it's fantastic and you can have also amazing desert! Won't be disappointed!
1	I love this store! It's like a baker's heaven! Every Christmas I buy her flavored chocolate to make treats for all my friends/family as gifts. She also has a nice variety of bakeware and other items. If you love to bake and experience, you must go!
1	Compared to most casino food in Vegas, this will seem like gourmet! I thought the food was delicious, the service good and the price reasonable. I'd definitely go back for seconds!
1	Excellent food, excellent service.  Pricey, but definitely worth it.  The ambiance is cozy and classy as you sit in a room with just a few other tables.  The Pot de Creme is amazing.
1	Okay - I have been in alot of Targets and Walmarts.  This store is absolutly the best.  The employees actually seem to enjoy being at work and smile and joke around.  You rarley have to wait in line for a register and the store is CLEAN.  Not sure about prices, I dont think they are that much higher than Walmart.
0	This is a review of the service for Ruffles Cafe. WORST SERVICE I've ever had in my entire life. I think it was like 20 minutes before we ever got our order taken and then another 20 for it to arrive. Then it arrived completely wrong. The whole thing was a mess! Just terrible all around. They are very lucky the food tastes good.
1	Hannah & Natasha, the two 20-something bartenders, are incredible bartenders! They give great service and make everyone feel welcome. 5 stars!
1	Fastest lunch ever.  Great vegan options.  Friendly service.  I wish my wife liked Chines because it would definitely be a dinner option.  For now, it's my quickie lunches at the bar.  Fried rice and crispy tofu!
0	They forgot my fries... C'mon guys, a combo meal is...say it with me... A burger + a drink + FRIES And yet they forgot the stinking fries.  Kid's screaming, can't turn the car around and get back in line...
0	If you like good service don't expect it here. Lousy at best. Table of 12 with only two other couples in the restaurant. Drinks stayed empty,  no ask for appetizers or dessert. Will not come back.
1	Our favorite restaurant in Madison! Love the cheese curds especially! A great spot for excellent food at an incredible value. And LOTS of beer choices. A Wisconsinite's dream!
1	I love this store!!  The produce is always so fresh and attractive looking.  They have some great deals and the staff are always friendly and helpful.  They have even put up with me when a couple of times I ran kind of late at night doing my shopping because there is so much to see!!  parking is right out front, great hours!  During the hot summer months, they even offered free small ice packs to keep my groceries cold on the drive home!!
1	Love this truck! The pork slider is a no brainer. Great tasting, flavorful, yummy. Hubby had the combo beef, pork and chicken plate and he enjoyed it thoroughly.  I like that they keep their calendar up to date on their website so I can find them when desired.  Definitely give them a try. The plates are huge and will feed you for several days - bonus!
1	Recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  We went there for breakfast.  The portions are sizeable (I had the French Toast and had trouble finishing the meal).  They serve a mean Bloody Mary.  You will have to drive to get there; by car it is a good 20 minute car drive from the strip.  But well worth the journey.
0	Ordered medium well burgers got medium rare. The food wasn't that great either! Services was horrible! BEWARE since they're so slow they will take your food away even when your not done eating! Told the manager about it and she didn't do anything. The sad part was she say she knew about it but I guess she was waiting for the customer to complained first. Wow never ever going back to this placed again. I would give it a 0 for the rating
0	Just tried upgrading my seat on United for my flights to Israel today. After being told I could pay $39 for premium seating (which is horse crap to begin with), I change my seats to the window seats I had been looking for and proceeded. United then tried charging me $208.00 for the "upgraded" seating option as apparently not all "premium seats" are created equal. Back to the middle seats for me as I have no patience for thieves and cheats.
1	I had a blast at MIX! The view was absolutely beautiful and the movie was really awesome (well except when they were getting ready to close). The atmosphere is really chill and the way everything is decorated is just amazing. I would definately come here again to eat, drink and dance!  I dont know how crowded it gets on the weekends because I went on a week day and it was still awesome! I would recommend this place to anyone :)
0	Bad service, slow and unnecessarily rude. Couldn't handle a table of 10 people with very simple orders. Food was decent but it was just disappointing.
1	I checked out this place with a buddy of mine for lunch while the rest of the party crew (unce unce unce) was battling hangovers back in the hotel room. The food can be pricey, but hey it's seafood and we're in Vegas and "turn down 4 what" right? We ordered a couple orders of stone crab claws along with hash browns and cole slaw. The crab was a hitter along with the mustard (mustard on the best ho!) sauce that was served with it. And that key lime pie to top it all off was money. Ca ching!
0	the worst food we have seen in scottsdale!  no other dinners on busy restaurant week! our food was horrible seafood not fresh. waitress seemed to be busy drinking with what seemed to be a few regular bar patrons.... nice location but don't waste your time. guess it will be closed soon , don't fall for a groupon, or living social.!!!!
1	We love this place.  We tried another children's hair salon a few months back and it was a horrible experience, not "kool" at all.  By the recommendation of a friend I took my twins to Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.  It was such a great experience, both my twins have gotten hair cuts a couple of times as well as my husband.  Miss Tara is really great with the kids, there is no more stress to go to get hair cuts!
1	Great place. Affordable pricing. Very friendly staff. Get the cheddars pain killer.  This place would be great to get together with friends in the bar without the loud club-like scene
1	Best Vietnamese in town! I used to live in Laos, and visited Vietnam a number of times. This place is a great memory lane for me. Really quick service, cozy feeling dining hall. I have never done the buffet, I always order strictly Viet food from the menu and have never been let down.
1	Awesome pizza in a pleasantly great  atmosphere  Short and Sweet! By far some of the best pizza I have ever had in my many travels across the United States!  Definitely WORTH a trip and a MUST to the scottsdale az
0	First off, I hardly write reviews mainly cause 1.) I'm usually too lazy due to food coma after an amazing meal and 2.) most crappy food places isn't crappy enough for me to think it deserves a bad review...but this on the other hand is an exception. 1.) Pricey 2.) Huge Portions 3.) Shitty Food It was the biggest shitty meal I've ever ordered. Would've rather eaten the $20 bill.
0	This place sucks, the service is horrible. We ordered our pizzas and only got one, when the "waitress" finally realized that she messed up she wanted us to wait for 45 minutes extra. Never come back, all the "servers" suck! The pizza is so greasy. Terrible food, terrible service. That's why they have drink specials, so you get drunk enough to think their food is good.
0	The person working there says the bathroom is out of order because someone stole the keys.  It's $.50 for ice in your own cup even if your buying a drink in a bottle.  She was rude and acted like she didn't speak English when anyone complained, but was fluent when ringing up others.  SMH.
1	Atmosphere was definitely 1930's/40's and food was excellent. The entertainment was a little loud, so it was hard to carry on a dinner conversation.  Friendly staff and food was served quickly.  Reservations is a good idea to guarantee seating.
0	I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now. But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ???? I left this dump. What a lousy way to start the day. Cocksuckers !!!
1	I've been going to this shop since they were in the meadows mall and I'm so happy that they finally got there own place!! I love this store!! They always have an amazing selection of plus size rockabilly and pinup clothing and great accessories. The girls are always so sweet and I can't wait till they open their pinup photo shop, it's going to be amazing!! You definitely need to check this place out you won't be sorry!!
1	Very happy with the work Ray and his team has done on my '07 BMW 328i.  With over 116K miles on my car it's good to have a shop I am comfortable with.  My car and I like Scott's Motor Werks.
1	Excellent!! My fiancee and I went here. The staff was very welcoming, very attentive and friendly. The food outstanding! I have never had Buffalo and I must say I have been missing out. It was cooked perfect along with my filet mignon. We had French Onion soup and escargot that was so delicious. We finished off with creme brulee flambe that alo g with the view it was delish. Allow around fantastic place to eat. The best meal I had in Montreal,if I came back it would definitely be to eat here.
0	I had lunch here and ordered Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, Trevi's signature dish. I was not impressed at all. It was a tad bland and not worth the $28.95 price tag. Service was okay, but server didn't stop back after serving the dish until it was time for the check. I've had better pasta dishes from local chains and restaurants than Trevi. I wouldn't recommend as a fantastic place to eat because I'm sure there are some actual fantastic Italian places in Vegas.
0	Guys watch your CASH, bartenders always try to rip you off. When they get a large $50 or $100 dollar bill they try to give you change for $20.  They treat you like crap. telling you: "What do you want?".
0	Second time here after a day of golfing. Food is okay, prices okay. Major complaint is service. This is a pub, and it took 20 minutes before someone came to our table and asked if we wanted some drinks. It happened.both times. The place was 75% full, not over packed. Service was so slow and hard to get, i don"'t think i would come here again.
0	How ridiculous, soft opening? Looked at website after I got there, it says they open at 4pm and sign on door says they open at 5pm. They need to figure this out, maybe I'll think about coming back. But with the reviews so far, doesn't seem like anyone should bother to waste time and money.
0	Just not the same taste as the Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill. We always get the fried pork chop rice, but the one on Craig st is less crispy and the seasoning is a bit lacking. The rice is different too (sort of like a friend rice but not really), and instead of pickled cabbage and carrots, you get a mix of frozen/canned corn and peas or something.  Will stick with the one in Squirrel Hill.
0	Horrible!! $8.00 for cold old cinnamon rolls then tried to see if they would give new ones and the employee was rude and said they are all that way and they can microwave them after microwave even worse now chewy like eating rubber this place sucks and customer service even worse !
0	Place was very plainly decorated. No receptionist. I sat for 30 minutes with no service and was only spoke to once. I ended up walking away without my brows done.
1	I'm pretty surprised by the reviews. We have been here more than a handful of timea for lunch and dinner. Food is fresh and plenty. Service is pleasant. Only drawbacks are long wait times for carry out and dine in. Orange chicken and hot sour soup are delicious!
0	Sehr schöne Räumlichkeiten. Ich war bislang nur auf einen Kaffee oder ein Bierchen da und kann leider keine Aussage zum Essen machen aber was mir jedes Mal aufgefallen ist, ist dass der Service auffallend schlecht ist. Unmotivierte Bedienungen die überhaupt nicht wahrnehmen wenn man gekommen ist und genervt schauen wenn man was bestellen will. Es war immer relativ voll, aber das ist kein Grund dafür nicht freundlich aufzutreten.
0	I've been here a couple of times and it is always seems to be the same.  The first half of my burger is great! Then the bun begins to crumble and fall apart.  This leaves me with an ugly mess on the wrapping in front of me and really just disappointed.   I have no complaints about the fries, they are actually very good.  The Cajun fries especially.  I only wish they had cheese fries.  Damn that yahoo article that told me otherwise...
1	Love love LOVE this place! It's always packed but well worth the stress. The prices are amazing and if you don't mind sifting a bit then you'll find a lot of great produce. I have never paid more than $20 for a cart full of stuff.
1	Veggie House is great for vegetarians and meat eaters too.  I've been veganish for a year and have been looking for a place like this for a long time.  The Szechuan shrimp I had was not exactly like scallop yet tasted satisfying.  The fried vegan ice cream desert is beyond dreamy..  Will be trying other dishes on the menu pretty soon.
1	Love this place! Not fancy, but a great neighborhood place that's always clean, prices are good, and the staff is always friendly. The gyro pita is tasty and loaded with plenty of meat to fill you up.  Their baklava is awesome too! JT is right around the corner from my father-in-law's place, so I make sure to get my gyro fix every time I'm in town.
0	I was reminded this morning why I prefer the Chandler location over this one.   My breakfast (eggs & bacon with pancakes) was perfectly cooked, but was unfortunately left in the window for far too long.  By the time it got to me, everything was pretty room temperature.  The butter wouldn't even melt that well on the pancakes.  Very disappointing.
1	This place is a little hidden gem. The food was fantastic. A little bit of Italy in Phoenix. Everything we had tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. I'll be back!
0	Not Impressed.  Music way to loud - server was an order taker ....People smoking on the patio (Gross) after waiting for 10 minutes for the Ice Tea we ordered, having smoke drift into my lunges and then struggling to hear the person I was sitting with -- we got up and left.  Yes, it looks charming BUT there is something off about this place.  We wont be back.
1	I really like this place. The fruit is really fresh and the yogurt is great. I have been to Pink  Berry as well as other similar places in LA and find it better plus the crepes are amazing.
0	I went into this nail salon for the first time with my 3 year-old daughter as she loves to get her nails done and looks forward to it every week. The owner did her nails. While she was painting them, she touched my daughter's forehead and said "She needs to wax her eyebrows." This was said to my daughter so she could hear. How anyone says this to a child is beyond me. I will NEVER go back and will tell everyone about this. I'm disgusted with this salon and the owner.
0	Burgers are just OK. Ice cream was very good but I'm not sure that all their ingredients are very fresh? Some pieces tasted a bit off. Probably won't come back here again.
0	Very marginal food, service, and atmosphere.  there is a live bill out front, and it really makes the whole area smell like cow flops. Disneyland atmosphere.
0	Very so so burgers. Best to head elsewhere for a burger. Lots of other options. Limited options. Service could easily be improved. Once at this place was enough. I won't be back
1	I've been to a couple local crossfit gyms and this has the best staff of trainers I've seen. The group vibe is great for all levels of crossfit athletes
0	Another dismal review for this company. I called for a 6 AM pickup to the airport like I had several times previously. Dispatch informed someone would arrive. I waited until 6:10 AM and called again-dispatch then told me another 15 minutes until pickup! I stated that was not acceptable as I had a flight to catch. I ended up driving myself to the airport. Oh yeah, the driver called, as boarding for my plane started.
0	Customer service here leaves a lot to be desired. Although they will help, it usually done with minimal personality and little to no professionalism.
1	I love, love, love this place for some tapas and sangria. Four of us went and split the tapas and a pitcher of the cinnamon-spiced sangria and had a fabulous time. The dates stuffed with almonds, wrapped in bacon and deep-fried are life-changing.
0	This place sucks! Had to tell them to vacuum my car again when I said why my inside looked so opaque customer survive guy said obviously the services are rushed were busy. Paid for the VIP. Waste of money. My car doesn't smell so I didn't get my air freshmen and my inside was def not dressed. And to top it off they parked my car underneath a tree with pollen falling. Fail!!!!
0	I've been talking to some of your neighbors long before the news and protests hit. To be honest, last time I ate there it was not good, so the plight of the workers must be coming out in your food. http://badgerherald.com/news/2014/04/28/takara-faces-criticism-allegedly-underpaying-workers-km/#.U2O5pfldWSo
1	This place is one of our family's regular spots.  The decor is wonderful, staff is attentive, the food is served fast (and it is SUPER cheap) and the food is wonderful.  They have one of the best chicken fried steaks I have ever had.  MANY lunch/dinner specials for about $6.  The steak with cheese and mushrooms is very flavorful and tender.  Also, for parents note the bar is in a completely separate room from their family friendly dining room.
0	Horrible.  So disappointed.  The food was old and tasted like cafeteria food.  Even the crab legs tasted off.  I am one to always try something once always give it a second chance, but I'm breaking my own rule and saying STAY AWAY!!!!
1	Dr. Nelson is a wonderful woman and doctor!  She was the first out of 4 drs who I felt truly comfortable with the care of my 5 yr old child.  She did an amazing job on his surgery and if you're looking for a dr who shows respect and true ability to make your entire process as easy as possible, she's the one to go to!  She went to the extent of giving us her home phone number in case we needed to reach her post surgery for any questions or concerns.  Truly gifted!
0	Wings were not good. Tasted very bland. Friendly service though. Not too many people here. TV was way too loud for the amount of people. Not sure how the 'family friendly' fits in: it's just another sports bar with blah food.
0	The hostesses were less than friendly, close to being rude.   We waited over 75 minutes for a table, but there were 13 people so we expected to wait.  Honestly it wasn't worth it though.  The food was overpriced although the steak sandwich $33 was pretty tasty.  The Frozen hot chocolate was like drinking chocolate milk with lots of whipped cream for $12!
1	I really enjoy this restaurant - the sandwiches, the salads, the mac & cheese, and the  sweet potato fries are all good. I also love that they have a gluten-free cheat sheet that tells you what meals are gluten-free as is or how to modify many of the items to be gluten-free.
0	Worst ever! I typically like these restaurants but this one is horrible.  Waited forever for our food and had to ask for one item since it was forgotten in the steamer. Then we were rewarded with it being slammed into a basket and shoved at us by a sneering girl who worked at a snail's pace. The chips were stale and the entire seating area a filthy mess. They weren't busy, so there's no excuse for any of this.
1	I love EVERYTHING I ordered here. Which is almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the lentil salad. I try to come here as often as I can.The desserts are delicious. Especially the chocolate leche cake. It's sooo good!  Milky & not to sweet . I always get the pitcher mojito's or pitcher sangria.   Service is always on point even if you come w/ big groups. They are always on top of everything. The restaurant is always clean & I like the red decor. Best tapas in vegas!
0	this place was okay, not as good as miami.  the crabs were definitely frozen and stuff, i can get that in queens, no need to get in vegas.  if u want the stonecrabs, just go to miami for the real thing.
1	Today was the second time eating here.  And besides the fact that the chicken on the chicken Caesar salad reminds me of warm tuna, everything else is really good.  I don't know maybe its me but chicken poached or not shouldn't taste like warm tuna....lol.  Any who I've been looking for places where you can create your own salad and this is a good one despite the taste which probably makes no sense to you I really love the chicken Caesar salad.  I wish it was one in the Matthews area, y'all should try it.
0	Terrible service. Extreeeemely slow. Crappy attitudes. Lazy food servers. The food was nothing impressive. Fast food at McDonalds is better in comparison. Save yourself time and wasting your money on crappy food. Seriously, you might as well get a frozen pizza. Inviting name and cool looking place, besides that, I have no idea how this place makes money. I will never ever go back to this place. It's just pitiful.  This is my first review on yelp. This place was that terrible, I just had to share...
0	Just your average Starbucks.  Nothing special.  The breakfast sandwiches are so hot and burn my mouth on every occassion.  I have told the sales people but they say they have to cook them at a certain temperature.
0	I didn't find it that bad, but it certainly wasn't good. It's a shame this place doesn't live up, because it's a neat-looking little diner in a great location. Service was typical Montreal aloof, food was not worth the time. Do yourself a favor and go to Cosmos down the street, or anywhere else at all really.
0	We took the short tour and I'ma tell you the truth, while our tour guide was entertaining, the most interesting part was the 10 minute movie before the tour. I think you get access to parts of the dam that you wouldn't normally if you're just visiting the dam without a tour, but I'm still not sure that it's worth it.
0	I do not like this apartment complex for various reasons...the a/c unit went out the first month my BF was in this place, the toilets dont flush correctly, it is loud as hell all the time, and someone hit the back of our truck and of course didnt leave a note :/
0	Had my son in classes here and they changed instructors with 0 notice i bought a bow from them that they recommended spent a few hundred bucks on it for my sons birthday they sold me a defective bow and when my son told me due to the fact that I know nothing about bows I tried to return it they won't help me out at all very bad company to work with the instructor is nice I must add
1	Gas prices have been going up again recently so I really appreciate that the cheapest station I have seen in days is right around the corner from my motel.  As of today, 11/21/10, their price is $2.69, less than the $2.71-$2.89 it is running other places. If you are anywhere near the NW corner of Country Club and 60, check this place out.
0	It's a below average, overpriced Chinese buffet.  Crab legs were overdone, stir-fry dishes all had a strange taste. They had a large selection of seafoods, but not the best quality (I know, I know--it IS an oriental buffet--what should I expect?). Two buffets and 1 soft drink...total $27.86...ouch!
0	Slow service. Waited 15 minutes without just a bowl of chips and no order taken. One server on a Sunday wasn't a good idea. Headed elsewhere.
1	Took my friend here to Drive the R8, and he loved it. He wants to come back from Germany and drive all the vehicles next time. The Drift ride is MY personal Favorite, even if i'm not driving, watching it brings me back to when I used to live in Japan. My cousin Rudy is a drifter for exotics and truly shows how its done in japan in a corvette in the states. A lot of people say, sure sure... its just a corvette... but I don't see any of the corvette owners drifting theirs as a job.
1	Funktion Design created/installed our company logo, enlarged it, and put it on one of our walls in our reception area. It looks incredible and makes an awesome impression as clients, applicants, and partners, enter our building.
0	I wrote Caesar's customer service about my terrible experience and referenced this review. Amazingly 4 useful votes disappeared that very day. Wonder how much they pay for that kind of service?
0	The service was good but the food was nasty. Veggies were frozen and overcooked. They looked gray. Steak was not cooked correctly and they did not even offer a new one. I would not suggest this place.
0	Not even worth the one star. Ordered eggplant parm.  Got spaghetti with some eggplant on top.  Terrible and will not go back.  This cost 16 dollars.  Salad was also bad.  Get a real business.
0	We stopped for breakfast this morning. Everything was ok, but not wonderful. The cashier wasn't listening & failed to give us our pastries. My husbands mocha was more like hot chocolate & my was just ok. My muffin was a bit on the stale side.
0	Arrived 6:50 am pulled up to the express oil change, (fast lane)  service mgr comes over to fill out ticket and asked me who my appt was with, when i told him i didnt have one he started being snippy, i never needed an appt before, ive been coming here 2-3x  a yr for 3  yrs, so i go into the lobby to find it filthy and no coffe yet, whats going on here in fancy scottsdale? I think i need to find a new Dodge place!!
0	Didn't even make it inside.  The line was about 6 people long and the elderly hostess did not speak to us once while we waited... and we were there for a while.  It WAS 11 PM - perhaps she was asleep standing up?
0	Taco Tueaday... Cool, clean taco shop'ish atmosphere - good for those who are skittish of your typical taco 'slop shops'.  Had two Carne Asada, one chicken and one Al Pastor. Though all were fairly unremarkable the chicken and Carne Asada were by far my least favorite. Very bland. Bummed as a good buddy highly recommended. Probably won't return.
1	Excellent food and a bargain compared to other restaurants at The Palazzo or Venetian. Locating in the Canal Shoppes, we actually ate there 3 times over the week we were in Vegas. The pasta dishes, pizza, soups, salads, and sandwiches (lunch only) were delicious. I grew up eating Italian food...and the food was quite excellent.
0	This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken.  The atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff. I hope to return soon and update my review ( :
1	This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!
1	Probably the best meatballs I have ever eaten. We loved the beer selection as well as the pesto! Will be coming back many times again!
1	Cheyenne at this location was absolutely amazing!! She was so sweet and fun and you can tell she actually really cares about the concerns and happiness of the customer. I was having a really bad day and was crying when I pulled up to the window and the moment she saw me and started talking to me with such a positive attitude it completely changed my mood!! Amazing customer service and someone should really consider giving that girl a raise.
1	Eagle services did a great job.  They got out to my house quickly to replace my water heater that was leaking.  They were pleasant on the phone and just provided great service overall.  Above and beyond.
0	Very disappointed in this cultural district restaurant.  The portions were miniscule, overpriced, and of poor quality.  The quail was tough and the "Seafood Risotto" consisted of 2 mussels, 2 small clams, a small, unidentifiable piece of fish served over a spoonful of too-salty risotto for $27!  There was no attempt at attractive presentation.  We left hungry with a $100 check.  It put a damper on the entire evening.  We won't be back.
1	We went back to try the pineapple fried rice and chicken matsaman curry. We were not disappointed! Five stars food and service. Again the Thai Iced Tea was excellent!
1	So, I had never gotten a spray tan before this experience.  It was surprisingly positive.  I thought I'd come out of there looking like that old chick in Something About Mary...but it looked FABULOUS!  It looked completely natural.  The whole process was quick, professional and comfortable.  I loved it and will be back.
1	Bronze Cafe all the way! Went Monday and we had such a great meal.  Everything was served wonderfully and the staff very helpful I had chicken salad San and it was a party in my mouth with all the floors. I went with vegan gluten free family and they had soup sandwich and cheesecake wow how great they finally have found a place they can enjoy we are spreading the word!
0	Wait to go here. They do not have the ability to handle a Friday night. Had reservations for 730. Left at 815. Not once did a manager come out to explain or apologize. Hopefully they will figure it out.
1	I mean really how can you beat a movie theater with extremely cheap tickets??  Yeah it's not the newest or the nicest, or even the cleanest (bathrooms are yuck).  But when you don't spend a small fortune on a movie and some snacks and you can have an enjoyable evening out with a good movie, I'd say its a win all around!
1	Places seem to come and go at this location I missed the last one.  came like the day after it shut its doors so I wasn't going to be left out this time.  Glad I went,  Had the Stand Cheeseburger, fries and a Banana Shake it was all good.(Love the HUGE straws) looking forward to making it back to try some of those Tacos!!   Lets see if we can keep this place going and break that bad location mojo.
1	Food was good and cheap. Small place and small menu.. We had the bacon burger with fries and the pulled pork. Fries were fresh cut...yum. We would go back.
1	Great italian food, all their pastas are homemade. Nice extensive wine selection, and some nights they have live music. Perfect location right across the street from hard rock.
1	Me and my wife come to this place all the time. She needs a lot of coffee, that's why. Anyways, we like to come here and get an black tea for me and an Americano for my wife and then head on over to Petsmart to look at puppies and kitties. Next we go over to Ross and try to score some sweet deals so we look like high fashion. That's basically how every weekend goes and it's all started by this very awesome Starbucks. A+
1	Have heard about this place but never tried it until yesterday. Very small cafe type but that's what I liked about it. Has a family owned at home feel to it. Menu has great selection. Was not in the mood for breakfast so had a sandwich it was still very good. I do want to come back and try the breakfast out. Service was friendly and quick. Will be back
0	We arrived here yesterday. The rooms are very nice, but the beds are awful!!!! We took 3 separate rooms and all of them had the same problem. It seems like these mattresses had been used forever.... Also, the doors are so heavy that we are constantly concern about our kids fingers; even for an adult its hard to open them. I would not recommend this hotel. Never coming back... We looked for a nice hotel w out cigaret smoke and casino, but this experience is not worth it....
0	Ouch & GROSS!  Expensive and Disgusting!!  "Cal-Ital" food...How stupid. Honestly, I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish, and it was absolutely tasteless.  It tasted like wallpaper paste!   It was surprisingly awful, since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street, which is very good. For good carbonara, go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy "The Bull" Gravano.  I choose good food over decore anytime!
1	Since the last time I came it has changed hands, etc. Today, the guy who helped me was super nice! Im preggers so while i like coffee I tend to avoid coffee while I am in the delicate condition. He was nice enough to make me a Grasshopper blended without coffee, so its mint and chocolate, basically a shake. Its really rich and sweet but its yummy! I'll be back and once i can have my iced tea fix daily, Ill Really be frequent!
0	Horrible customer service. Manager would not substitute toast for eggs despite having an allergy. Would not even discount the price for not including eggs. We we told that we could purchase something else and what did we expect coming to a "farm fresh restaurant". We are locals and will not be eating there ever again. So disappointing.
1	Great Bloody Mary's and 5 bucks is a great price considering the location. I was very thankful for the celery. For some reason so many bars leave that out but the Le Petite Bar is on their game. Keep it up!
1	This is the best bar in the area. The food on the menu is diverse, and everything is pretty much great. I believe there are 14-17 beers on tap (6 or 7 oggi's, 3 domestic garbage, 5-6 rotating guest craft beers). Happy hour goes from 3-7 and varies depending on the day, with all day happy hour friday-sunday. Steph is an awesome bartender, so stop by for lunch! Stop reading reviews and just go there
1	I've been coming to this location since they opened. Before that I would drive to Scottsdale. Try the butcher's block and the different bruschettas split with someone.
1	Just wanted to highly recommend John at this location for those who get deep tissue massages. He was very thorough and my 90 minute massage was one of the best Ive ever had. Very professional and experienced!
0	When I first moved to Tempe this was one of the best places for a slice. However more recently they have been getting pretty bad in quality. I actually prefer some of the cheaper places in the area because their quality has gone down so much.
1	Being new to the city I am so glad I found this place. Awesome atmosphere, great people and a quality haircut to match. I'll be back again soon!
1	Considering that finding delivery in South Phoenix is nearly impossible, this place is a gem. We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu, and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food, not to mention the great prices... Under $4 for lunch??? Seriously!.  The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home.  We would order from here again in a heartbeat.
1	We had such an amazing photographer.  He was very professional and made our whole wedding experience fun! The pictures are absolutely beautiful!!!  I would highly recommend using Imagine Studios.
1	My first time here and I would definitely come back. I got the toxin flush juice and it was tasty. Quick and easy. Sometimes it's hard to find healthy when I'm on the go, but this was perfect. I just wish it was closet to my house!
1	Sabas has been around forever,  and the quality has always been consistently good.  Their $5 gyro pita deal is insane for the great gyro you get.  The tzazilki (I know I spelled that wrong) is delicious.   Try the lamb too, its veey good. The owners and staff are always very nice.  Good local spot.
1	L'ancien forum est devenu un cinéma comptant plusieurs salles. Il est agréable d'y aller pour se remémorer les grandes années de hockey qui y ont eu lieu.
1	It was wonderful.  It's not cheap but they are not cheap on the serving sizes and quality.  I think I was over served with some great food.
1	food is still good , slice of pastami n rye is heaven on earth, with dr brown root beer no y ou didn't jgo for the ambience its those delcious heartstoping sandwhciches..and be patient you mave have wait for a table.. but you can always take out..smile
0	It has a great atmosphere, but food is lacking. The service was slow but they are still in training so I understand. I ordered a french dip sandwich that looked like it was served on a hot dog bun. It was hard to see it under all the onion rings it was buried under. The chips and spinach dip was good, but not enough dip to the amount of chips. They seem to pile on the sides and go light on the main dish.  This would be a good place to grab a beer and watch the game, but not to sit down and eat.
1	Great if you want chilli on your burgers and fries. Not something I would want all the time, but if you do Tommy's is the best place to get it. Burgers are great and so are the fries. Cheap and very filling!
0	The salad was good but nothing you couldn't get at a supermarket's salad bar for far less money. The man behind the counter was surly. I'm not too demanding when it comes to customer service but he seemed genuinely annoyed that we were there. It was a weekday during what should have been lunch rush and it wasn't busy.
0	I've said it before and I'll say it again I don't send food back its not something I like to do. I hate to complain so I don't but man if I was the type I would have. My steak was horrible. It looked like it was left on one side to cook then the last 2sec it was turned. It was over cooked and the little pink that there was was all on the bottom of the steak. Not the middle the bottom. I could have cooked a better steak. Bryan's filet was very fatty. It was just bad. Will not be returning here.
0	I'd rather go to a red mango or pink berry. They offer a variety of flavors and toppings. But yogurt here has a weird after taste most likely due to all the artificial flavorings and preservatives.
1	J'ai essayé beaucoup de café au centre-ville et je reviens toujours à celui là, qui est probablement le meilleur. Il s'agit d'un simple comptoir caché dans un tunnel, avec des baristas exceptionnels! Un must!
0	This location is actually closed now.  When I went, I brought in 2 huge bags of clothes which included New French connection heels, some vintage Ben Sherman, etc. Everything I brought is was in good condition. After looking through everything for 15 minutes, they told me they had no use for any of these things. Really? Ben Sherman? Their loss, so I sold them on eBay and made some good money. No point of returning. Selection in this store looked like a goodwill on a bad day for triple their price.
1	Always a great place, we visit Los Dos 1-2x everytime we are in Phoenix yearly. This time we gave the Mesa location a go, opposed to the original. Food and service were great as usual, however the food didnt seem as spicy as at the original Los Dos and the ambiance is not the same...has more of the standard restuarant look and feel. Not a knock at all...still amazing food regardless!!!
0	Tasty food, super friendly and efficient staff, ice cold beer. Why only 2 stars then? Sewer problem, the bar had a very bad odor that the staff tried to mask it with a candle in the restroom and by opening the doors on a cold night.  Not the first time we've experienced this there. Hope it's fixed soon or we may have to find another watering hole- too bad.
0	The latte is good (trust me, almost any coffee would be good after a night out in vegas and early morning conference wake up call), but the lines here are ridiculous since it's right next to the conference area. Save yourself some time and go to the Starbucks outside. It'll be faster (even though it looks farther).
1	Here's the deal.  The food sounds special but it really isn't, and normally that would doom a place to me.  But... I keep coming back.  Why?  Because I don't come here to eat amazing food.  I come here to hang out in a casually stylish environment with good music and truly good coffee in a dedicated daytime establishment.  VVM definitely owns its slice of the restaurant ocean by sticking to a simple and stylish formula.
1	I don't understand all these negative reviews.  This place is bomb! I got tacos and chips here on my way out of the Palms, and even after my 20 minute drive home, the food was delish!  The carne asada in the tacos was tender and full of flavor and the .  I wish I lived closed to the hotel so I could eat here more often!
1	LOVE. THIS. PLACE. First tried this place on my drive cross-country and it was very good. I raved about the burger to everyone for a very long time. By chance, when I was visiting home in the south, I spotted that culver's sign out of the corner of my eye and proceeded to flip out. My passenger in the car was baffled at my sudden excitement.  On the way back from my primary destination, I stopped here and my friend and I were in burger & shake heaven.
1	Husband ordered portobello burger from vegetarian menu and said it was the best burger! My mashed potatoes with a side of Alfredo were delicious. My co-worker ordered a chicken salad and said it was amazing. Waitress Miriam was a but off. Food was excellent.
1	This place is amazing. What friendly service too! I ordered the steak w poached eggs on chilequiles . Everything was SO fresh and delicious tasting!!!!!!! My steak (ordered med rare) was cooked perfectly and tender! And the waitress was so nice & attentive. Loooooooove this place !
1	I went there for my first massage ever recently. I had Tyler and he was wonderful. I was having bad pain in my lower back and I have not had any pain since my visit. It was an overall peaceful and pleasant experience. I left feeling so relaxed and I will be visiting again sometime soon.  Unlike some of the others comments I luckily did not get hassled about getting the membership. They asked me if I would be interested in it and when I said no they moved on.
1	All you need is LOVE!  I've been waiting to see this show since it came out.  It's always been too expensive so when we saw a deal online, we jumped on it!  The show was amazing!  They sell big drinks for $15.  I kept the cup!  I love the music...I love the beatles!
0	What happened? The place is filthy. When you walk is the first thing you see is the dust and fly traps on the red duct work. The counter, floor, walk is is all disgusting. Hand prints, crumbs, dirt, where is health services? Wow this place went down fast..
0	The worse ice cream ever. Even my 7 yo said so. We tried the mango & mint chip. Both had grainy texture. The chocolate macadamia had extremely stale nuts. The depressing ambience fit this experience.
1	Best Vietnamese Food in Vegas. Spring rolls were on point just like their sister restaurant in Orange County, their seafood banh canh was flavorful, and their banh xeo was just up to par. Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and the owner is personable.  I am so grateful now that I don't need to search for delicious Vietnamese food here in Vegas anymore!!  And yes, it's located on Spring Mountain
0	Update: This Winchells that I reviewed  on N. Decatur  has now closed and is now Dulce Donuts.    I hope to go over to Dulce Donuts soon and try them.  (the two stars are for the Winchells that was here. I just wanted to update so everyone knows that it is now closed)
1	A good amount of good food for a good price. The seating is limited to approx 5 big tables which seat 6 each. I ordered a #11 combination meal which included a hearty amount of beans and rice along with an enchilada and tamale for $5.99.  Their menu is huge though and contains many distinctive Mexican dishes that I've not heard of but I'm sure are delicious.
0	Food is delicious. However the service is terrible. We had a reservation. When we arrived, tables were available but we weren't seated for 10 minutes. It was another 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. Water was not provided until our food came. We never received a bread basket. Same story when waiting for the bill. We were completely ignored. It would have been better just to have ordered from the to-go window.
0	Booked a table for 1 through Opentable. When I got there, I was told they would seat me at the bar because the tables were reserved for family style dinner and the portions are designed for sharing food. Ridiculous argument. If I book a table through Opentable, I expect a table, not a barstool.
1	Came here for a late lunch around 4 it was not too busy so we got seated quickly Ordered pho combo beef was good, tendon was good, soupe was hot  ordered bo tai jun it was tasty!! only thing was serving was a little small but its cool keeps you from getting  fat!! Service was good I'll be back!!!!!!!!!
0	Three chill dog and fries, with drinks comes out to fifty dollars. Fries were bland, the chill had no flavor. Regular bun and hot dog if was for the industrial era.  Service was petty slow. Drink were cheeper at the stalls next to Nathan's.
1	A small selection of guest taps and a solid offering of a handful of their own brews. The Imperial Stout was outstanding! The guys behind the bar might be having a little too much fun. Never stopped smiling or joking around. It was difficult to walk past Banger tonight, but I had a bottle of Firestone Stickee Monkee waiting for me at Oak & Ivory at the Downtown Container Park. Watch for a six-star review of that we hen possible!
1	Why oh why don't they have a Cracker Barrel in Califonia??!!  My friends and I were in the Phoenix area this weekend and this was first on our list to eat!  We were excited to eat our breakfast here!  We also love browsing through the country store and sitting outside in the rocking chairs.  I hope one day this chain will expand to the Pacific Coast.
1	If you are looking for the best apartments in Scottsdale, I would definitely recommend Liv North Scottsdale. The staff is so nice and helpful. I would give them a call to be put on the list for when they open this fall!
0	The service is never good but this time we waited 20 minutes for a drink order and 1 1/2 hours for our food.  Chili Rellenos burnt, Torilla Soup a pasty mush and the tacos had no flavor.  The owner was rude and when we asked when we would get our food she said "That they are very busy and we would just have to wait"!!  If the owner says that there is no one else to go to for help.  It was a terrible evening.  I am a local and know all the restaurants in the area.  Try somewhere else!
1	Great pizza and wings! The polish sausage's are the best and their hot roast beef sandwiches are awesome! If you are ever around McDonald & Granite Reef in Scottsdale you have try this place! You'll love it!
0	My cousin took us here to try this place out since it's one of her favorite  spots. Not a fan of their service since they were REALLY short handed.  Never checked on us until the end of the meal.  Things were forgotten. We ordered the steamed egg since it's my daughter's favorite dish, but it was overcooked.  She didn't eat as much as she normally does when it's yummy. But, if service doesn't bother you then this place has good BBQ.
0	Read all of the positive reviews so we went to Le Peep this past Mother's Day. Very disappointed!  The food is very average. We ordered the sausage skillet, omelet and pancakes.  All were over cooked. The decor is very dated and desperately needs an update.  Will not be returning.
0	Went here to around 5:30 to get a iced decaf coffee. Found out they can never make a decaf coffee that is iced.  I was fine with that and tried to order a hot cup of decaf coffee instead, only to find out that they stop brewing decaf at 12pm.... HOW CAN A STARBUCKS NOT HAVE DECAF COFFE!?!?  They sell coffee for a business.    This makes no sense.....
1	LOVED this place! Low key, chill hangout spot. My favorite part was the mini bar where you are served by midget a bartender. There is an old school juke box in the corner that has a huge selection of old and new hits. There is huge tree swing at the main bar, tins of huge adult drunken games, too many too list/describe. I recomend just getting your booty down there and enjoy yourself! This bar is great for the active, fun adventure seeking type of drunken night! : )
1	Wow! The food here was amazing! Our party of five stopped here in Oct 2013 and we really enjoyed the food.  We were served plenty of crispy pita bread available when ordering hummus, and it was topped off when our entrees arrived. Next time I am in Madison, this will be one of my stops.
1	This place is awesome! The food is delicious!  The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. I'm a vegetarian and they have plenty of options for me. I will be back and I am telling all my friends to try this place!
0	Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible.
0	Girls:  Not the place to meet your mate.   Most waitresses had huge, exposed boobs.   A hiring criteria?  Waiters duds was fine.  Interesting?  Fish and chips were way too hard.
0	Driver's are crooks! They write in their own tips! Managers aren't very helpful either! All crooks! order somewhere else, not here!
1	Stopped in for a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon. Had the 1/4 burger with fries. Very good burger, hot crispy fries and good service.
0	The service does not exist here.  The worker is just laughing and hanging out with a friend while you self-serve and have to interrupt their conversation to pay.  The worker was chatting with her friend even while I'm paying. That said, their yogurt is one of my favorites :)  Try their greek yogurt.  Everything else is icy and not my taste.
0	Wow, what a disappointment! We read all the glowing Yelp reviews and were expecting amazing sandwhiches served at a local institution. After walking through a smokey casino, what we got was very overpriced, salty, small, mediocre salads and sandwhiches. Moreover, the atomoshpere is just one notch above a Subway. In a reastaurant mecca like Vegas, there are better lunch options.
1	I was just hungry. I ordered the Cajun chicken lil bits. They were not little and the portion size was unbelievable. I can put away some good and there was plenty left for a good lunch.  Gotta love the portion sizes! Bartender was cool as well
0	The prices are very reasonable. But there's a reason for it. The sushi lacks, oh what is it, flavor?? I was caught off guard as when I came in I was welcomed with the awesome aroma of the teppanyaki. I'm a big sushi fan and was disappointed with the quality.  It might have been an off day and I'll have to go back and try but I ordered tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Nice venue.  Great location.  Hopefully the next time will be better.
0	Wife and I had the Chicken Kabob plate. Very disappointed. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The saffron rice was cold. The place is very spacious and clean. Service was prompt. No one asked how the meal is.  Probably won't go back there again. Too bad, I really enjoy mid-eastern cuisine.
0	I came here this morning for breakfast and I already got a bad vibe when I entered. The customer service was not very nice and they treated us Like garbage. The soups are not good. Very high in sodium and the chili is the worst chili I have ever had. The corn bread was not moist. The chobb salad was very good though. I do not recommend this place though.
0	I have not sat down to eat here, I have always got it to go. The food here is just bland. How people give it four stars just blows my mind. The food seemed like it was sitting around for awhile in the kitchen before beeing served. I live 2 blocks from the place, so it didn't happen because I had to drive home.  I have given it multiple tries to make make sure it wasn't a one time bad mealI would not recommend this place to anyone.
1	Wonderful!   I love this place.  I would have never tried it on my own, but a friend introduced me to it and I have loved it ever since.  They have a cool decor and great food.  I recommend the Panang Curry and Pad See Ewe.  Both are delicious.     They have weird hours with a gap during the afternoon and are closed one day a week I think, but definitely a place worth checking out.  You wont be disappointed.
0	What is going on Flamingo? This has been our go to place several times a year for the past 5 years. Great location but the service has gone downhill!  Wed. before Thanksgiving, 1400 guests expected, yet only 3 people checking folks in. Line for keys was even longer!! Took longer than usual to get our baggage, got to room and keys not working. Stay tuned for room rating...
1	We frequent this place because we can walk there. The servers always remember my kids, this place is kid friendly. They remember us too when we leave the kids home and go to the bar (I know, parent of the year). The wings are good, my kids love the mozzarella sticks and pizza. They have karaoke some nights. They have a magic guy some nights. It's They have TV's for the sports.  Good enough for me. I can always find Brenden there!  Hey Brenden, your wife is lookin' for ya.
0	So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella.
0	Beware of misleading prices. At the register, you will learn that you will pay much more than the price posted. You have to go online to obtain a rebate. Really?? Hello Best Buy or Target, both down the street.
1	I wouldn't say it's fine dining but I will say if you would like a good meal with an Italian flair, fair price and good service, Carrabbas is the place to go.
0	A real dump as far as Del Taco locations go. The Bus Stop out front provides a steady stream of degenerates coming in and out. Fairly clean inside and the food was average for a Del Taco, but the service was SLOW. I wish I could type slower to emphasize just how S-L-O-W it really is here. =O)
0	The tables in the bar area are super small, so don't plan on getting much food. It won't fit. The tacos were pretty good, except the veggie one. They are going out of business, so they don't have all of the liquors listed on the menu. Slow service. Ambience is somewhere between modern and college with color changing bar lights.
0	Maybe it was the time of day (afternoon) but something was very off today. The cheese plate arrived long after the entrees, my companion's bacon wrapped scallops seemed uncooked and raw.   The chicken schnitzel was fine.   Good beer and wine selection.  Slow service.
0	paid $30 for lunch for my daughter and I.  Big rip off. For that price I could have gotten a better meal almost anywhere.  The food was disgusting. We barley ate more than 5 bites.  I could not eat the meat.  It was tough.  The side dishes looked they were just something they pull out of a can.  The entrance smelled like urine.  I felt like I was in the walmart of buffet restaurants. I ended up with stomach cramps just from eating stuffing and mashed potatoes.
1	Chile Roast Beef tacos were excellent! Daughter loved that you could make a ton of different drinks. Suggest going on Taco Tuesday...taco's 1.00 off
1	I called this place because the people on the phone for the Chinese food delivery place closer to me were rude. The folks here were very polite. The food was good. Although I would not call the portions generous I didn't feel cheated.   There was an issue with the charge to my debit card. They researched the issue and resolved it the same day. Overall I'm pleased with this place.
1	We had to rush in and rush out. So we got what we wanted. Great service, great menu, and accommodating. Having only been here once so far, we'll go again.
1	Highly recommend this place. I have told many of my co-workers about this place because it's so good. The Mexican food is great with amazing ambiance and a gorgeous building. The service was a bit slow and inattentive but we went fairly late so there is that.  If you go, you must try the Sopapillas! They are to die for! Great for a date night place too!
0	Disappointed, I was there 3 days/2 nights, I was never able to use the WiFi...same problem 5 years ago... Good accommodation for $40, the tower is the top..the gym, no comment!
0	This is an "OK" Greek place, but no where near the best. Our last few trips have been a big let down and I forgot to call an tell them so I'll tell all: the salads are $10 for a small portion of ragged old lettuce and a few pieces of chicken here an there. The gyro my husband had was also skimping on portion and the pita was hard! Their meals are also pricey in my opinion and you'll get crap fries, compared to the alternative My Big Fat Greek.
0	If you like food seasoned with half a can of salt then this is your place. If you like your food being served to your husband and your kid and wait 30 minutes for your plate, then this is the place for you! The cashier was so apologetic and gave me a desert for free to try to make up for it at least. But Id expect WAY better for $45. At this rate and flavor, Filiberto's or Taco Bell would have been a better choice.
0	Rude front desk clerk, Jack. Sounded annoyed when I called to complain about the room next door and their howling dog for the 2nd night in a row. Lame breakfast bar and the advertisement for a kitchen in the room is actually a tiny little door that has a mini microwave and mini refrigerator. No stove. Wouldn't stay here again even for free.
0	I don't even want to give this one star... the staff at the front desk was less than courteous.  the walls in the rooms are cement blocks, makes you feel like you're in prison.. there was candy smeared all over the floors, and popcorn not even vacuumed up.  the dust on top of the TV was so thick I wrote "wash me" on it.  The air conditioning would not stay on... It smelled in there.. DO NOT stay here. Yes, it was cheap, but spend a couple extra bucks and get a real hotel room!
0	Yeesh, my second visit to this place bared little resemblance to the first. Most polarizing was the service. Our server was nice enough, but she was completely clueless (forgetting multiple things) and ever so slow (with a section that was not full). Additionally, the quality of the pizza was not up to the same high standards of the first visit. I will probably give this joint another chance, but will be much more reluctant now.
0	I would rate it 3 stars, but the service was horrible. My buddy and I went for pick-up and he had an Entertainment Book coupon which was a "Buy one get one free." The guy working the counter wouldn't honor the coupon. He kept saying that they were running a special that was a better deal than the coupon. A line starting forming and we just paid the full price to avoid the hassle. Granted, if you are expecting to pay full price, it may be worth it. If you have a coupon, don't even think about it.
0	Don't eat here if you want good food.  I thought it was expensive for what you get and its too noisy and dark.  Do not ask to sit by the waterfall because you wouldn't be able to hear the person across from you.  Then there was thunder every 10 minutes, it got pretty annoying.  And its dark inside.  What a waste of money.
0	Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient, still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing!
1	I really do enjoy this place, great food, wonderful staff. The food selection is what you would expect, nothing but 5 Stars here, from the moment you are seated to the time you leave.
1	The Filiberto's of the West Valley!!! Really like this place! I have been here about three times, get the same old steak and egg burrito, w/beans and potato's! And of course add a little bit of pico! Never been disappointed, a very large serving, and has had very good service. Place looks like its closed down! But it's not, they just blacked the windows to keep the sun out! Family keeps on asking me when I will take them? Soon!
1	Da ich schon seit einer Weile versuche, so viel wie möglich vegan zu leben, war ein Besuch bei Kai's Pizza ein Muss. Denn sämtliche Gerichte werden hier auf Wunsch mit Wilmersburger serviert. Für 1EUR mehr gibt's sogar nen Teig aus Dinkel- oder Vollkorn statt Weizenmehl. Kurz zur Pizza: Geschmacklich toll, lecker knusprig und ausgezeichnet gewürzt. Auch für nicht-Veganer eine echte Empfehlung!
0	While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt.  I was led astray!  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door.  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.
1	Awesome customer service! Very knowledgeable and friendly employees! Clean, inviting atmosphere with lots of variety in products and juices! I just stumbled on this place while driving by and ran in to get a much needed coil. They didn't carry it anymore so they game me a similar one for free!!!! Even though I live 20 min in the other direction, I plan to always come back to this e-cig store because of this experience!!
0	Customer service sucks. They say one thing & do another. If your looking for a good gun shop in henderson, go to spurlocks.  Never again will they have my business nor the rest of my families that went there.
0	Tried the fish tacos and they weren't really exciting. The place seems like a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with friends but it's not worth a special trip.
0	Very disappointed. We ordered margaritas during the Mayweather fight but they tasted like virgins and the waiter tried to convince us that they were not virgins. Do not order the margaritas they are watered down.
1	Great service - very quick, definitely use the coupons - and the evaluation was honest and fair - and no pressure is applied - I would go back again
0	Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul.
1	Pete and Derek very good. ..i'm happy and satisfied! They were right on time at 9 AM . They were careful with our stuff , no complaints , no damages . Pete and Derek were nice and polite as well. Thank you Warren's. ..:)
1	Great Thai and Chinese food. Friendly family staff. We were served by their very cool 11year old son. Kind of place you want to support. Food was excellent and very reasonable. Go for the curry-
0	Played on 2/3/14.  Very poor conditions, both fairways & greens.  I would rate this as the worst course I have played in AZ.  Also the green fee of $85 is ridiculous.  Green fee does not include range balls, that were seemingly taken out of the desert & ponds. Two thumbs down!
0	WARNING!!!! Do NOT rent or use this company for your management needs. If you rent from them say goodbye to your entire deposit. I was renting a property managed by this company and not only did they took my entire deposit but they are actually charging me more on top of that. I left the house in great condition. I added landscape and took really good care of it. This are very bad people. They take advantage of common renters like you or me.
0	This was the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. I went there with my boyfriend. They asked for tip up front. My boyfriend ordered green tea. They were out of green tea, so the associate offered a different tea instead of making more green tea. I ordered coffee and was not even pointed to the coffee bar to get cream. Our food took forever to be delivered to our table. My soup was cold! Avoid this place like the plague. The restaurant looks like a gutter and the service was horrible.
1	my favorite lunch spot everytime i come to vegas.  they have a great selection of burgers and the largest assortment of topping i have ever seen in my life.  i love the jalapeno bacon and the kobe burger.  for the non meat lovers, they also serve a great salmon burger as well. be prepared to wait a little if you arrive there late.
0	Great bartenders.   Tight machines.  Players benefits going downhill.  Must leave all VIP dinner food at restaurant.  No take home on leftovers.  VIP dinners aren't so VIP.  Non VIP customers treated better.  Shrimp dinners are a joke.
1	Service was perfect! And the food was more better. I shall return for more Pho and spring rolls. So delicious. -Above was my first review. This is my second. I love this very friendly and homey place. The food is delicious. I will return again again when I have a taste for Pho. Yum!
1	Guy is an amazing tour guide! We had so much fun on our night tour of the Neon Museum. Guy gave a fun and very educational tour, I can't wait to go back and see it during the day. I highly recommend this tour for anyone interested in Las Vegas history.
1	THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN, totally love the grill, the breakfast buffet and the Sunday Roast beef is to die for, don't forget to check out the luscious bakery and fabulous fragrances, gifts and flowers, it is the ULTIMATE in shopping and I love this place!!!!
1	got a great deal online. $20 a night for one room and free steak dinner for two (no purchase necessary, not like other offer that buy one get one free) plus other free slot and table match play. It's like staying for free!  so no complaints from me. room size is decent and clean , parking is easy, and $3 black jack table for a small time gambler like me is perfect! want to come back here every weekend for this deal!
0	I like eating here for the soup.  But this time the service was horrible. They kept my daughter waiting for her chicken tenders, REALLY???  Our food was cold by the time she got her food, then they only gave us a discount.
1	My mom and I both have used Frank for multiple plumbing needs.  Replaced toilets, water filters, sink faucets, garbage disposals, you name it.  Frank is ALWAYS on time, completely honest, very clean and neat, and friendly.  His pricing is reasonable, not the cheapest, but not over-inflated.  He is up-front about the cost for any parts he purchases. I feel safe having Frank in our home and know that he will get the job done.
0	Food was cold and dry, waffles over cooked, pancakes under cooked, price of $30 for brunch DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT. Better selection of desserts, but odd combinations of fruit soured their taste.
0	Dang I wish I knew this was on Yelp. I would save the time and money. I am a hardcore JFK fan. my license plate is JFK! and boy was I disappointed. Everything is a replica, items are scattered in a huge meeting/ event room, it looks so amateurish I felt like it was disrespectful to the 35th president.  Even if it was free admission I'd still be disappointed and upset.  I could have done a better job doing it in my living room.  Shame on you Tropicana!
1	While in WI for a wedding we had occasion to stop in and grab a bite.  And it was a very good thing we did. The food was great, and the service even better. Now, I am not a big fan of the overt birthday celebration, or the scores of waitstaff singing off key...but here, it was pretty nice to hear them do it for various patrons.  So yes, if in town on my birthday I wouldn't mind them singing for me.
1	It's so hard to find a good hair salon and hairdresser. After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try after having a disastrous haircut somewhere else. The staff here are super friendly and their prices are very good. I also got a great haircut! Keely paid a lot of attention to my hair type (medium curls) and gave me a great cut that makes my curls look awesome. I will definitely be coming back.
1	Awesome food. First time here so I can't guarantee all the items, but what I tried makes me think the menu is promising. Wow. Yum. And they have a daily special that's happy hour prices. Not to mention the awesome chips and dip (mild, hot hot, and spicy bean dip) that come out as soon as u sit. Yum!
0	The buffet on Fridays and Saturdays is 35.99. They charged extra for soda at 2.95. This is way more than it's worth.  I was here last year and had a better memory of it. I am not planning on going back because it's definitely not worth it to me.  Also, you even have to get your own knives, forks, and napkins. These are not even set up on the table.  Nothing is likely to wow you. Plus it's in the Miracle Mile mall, tucked away down a hallway. I enjoyed other casino-based buffets better.
1	Great food - very fast for takeout! The family meal is a bargain - with plenty for a large family.   We have eaten in a few times (not a lot of tables) and taken out many more.  The food is delicious and the service very prompt.  If you call in the order, it will be ready by the time you can get there.
1	DELICIOUS FOOD! The service was wonderful.  We ordered the bbq and the servers helped us cook the food.  It was a great value for the amount of food they give you.  I loved the Chap Chae and the tofu soup was awesome too.  We'll definitely be back.
1	This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through.
0	Great name . Average food.  Actually, come to think of it the Tortilla soup was quite good. The cheese enchiladas... not so much.  Service was pretty good. And there is a nice patio. Music was awful.
1	One of the greatest customer service in town. They know exactly what they were doing unlike other repair places that is after my money. I had my phone repaired the other day and had it done within the hour as they promised.  The staff is really friendly the ambiance is casual and cozy. They also hold car meets for everybody to get together.   I don't recommend places often but this places is definitely a must to go to. If you need any repairs on your phone this is the place to go.
1	Have taken my 18 month old Goldendoodle Chesney here probably 8 times at this point.  Chesney is a large dog with a ton of curly hair.  We have always been pleased with the service here and when there was a minor issue during one of the appointments the owner was fantastic and couldn't have handled the situation any better.  Definitely give her a try.
0	Service terrible - hostess was rude and took forever to get a waitress, the menu is not appropriate for children - many menu names X RATED.  The atmosphere is beautiful dark woods and reds. If they paid as much attention to their food and their customers as they did the decor, it would be a 10.
0	I agree with Don J. We ate there this week, and had the barbeque burger (with a split fee), and there was nothing special about the burger at all. Our wait staff was attentive, though one of the staff members had BO which was noticeable standing beside our table.  The onion rings were good, but there just isn't anything that would compel us to go back.
0	This is literally the worst internet I've had in 8 years. The man that connected the service was nice. I've had it for a week and half, paying for 10Mbps and consistently test at less than ONE Mbps. I have been trying to watch a 4 minute youtube video for an hour. AN HOUR. This is ridiculous.  If they grant me my request to discontinue service I will give them another star for customer service.
1	Tamales are excellent!  Staff is friendly and the place is pleasant.  I had the taco dinner with an extra tamale to go.  The rice and beans are authentic and I really did like the tacos very much.  The only complaint I had was their hot sauce really wasn't hot enough for my taste but all in all, I will be back.
0	southwest is starting to not be as good as it used to be. i seem to be delayed on 80% of the flights i take! i probably wont stop flying them cuz they still are the cheapest (usually). so, i guess you get what you pay for!
1	We drive into Vegas from the CA side several times a year. We always make one of our stops Green Valley. I know that they are now part of the station casinos but this is one of our favorite ones. Very clean, nice decor, not smokey and they have my fave place in the food court, Coffee bean and tea leaf. I love going off strip for buffets because they all serve Pepsi where the strip is strictly coke products. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.
0	Dive bar filled with perverts and heroin addicts. Looks like an Intervention Convention. Bartenders are weathered and bitter. Food tastes bad and they charge way too much considering they are a dive bar and not a nightclub.
0	Can you say crappy service? They stole $59 from my boba card. Freaking ridiculous. Will never eat here ever again. Waitresses speak broken English and ignores my right too.
1	You feel the family ambiance as soon as you walk in. The server's are very attentive and greet you with their name. The food is great! My party of 4 had the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, Mamas Breakfast Burrito, Denver Omelet and French Toast. The food was delicious! The restaurant is small however it's worth the wait.
1	The girls and I really like to go here after work (which happens to be 3pm or so), which means there is always happy hour and there aren't huge crowds. Ive been here on a Sunday, and it's crazy. This is why I love going after work... Mondays are also a great drink special day, $4 margaritas, but make sure not to go too crazy, or you'll end up taking a cab home...which we have also done... but we always have fun!
1	Food and service was outstanding. Very flavorful and presentation was exceptional. Unfortunately the front end folks had an attitude because of our appearance (dress). If you can get pass that every thing else is worth the trip.  Thumbs up to the food and service. Thumbs down to the arrogant stiffs  up front.
0	Absolute worst experience I have had living in an apartment, the staff is super rude and always trying to make an extra dollar off of you any way they can, the place itself is ghetto and not kept very clean, with a dirty vagrant vibe to all of the residents. Always had the feeling like I was going to get mugged walking around outside. Please avoid this place at all costs, they try to lure you in with the promise of good deals but you will for sure pay for it in the end.
1	extremely convenient for wynn guests because it's just right across from the hotel. outside looked small but the inside is surprisingly big with all the big dept stores like Saks, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus i think, another that starts with a D and Macys. Kinda like mid range products and you can find anything from fashion to electronics(apple) to convenience store etc.
0	Tried to go in here on a Saturday night after a coyotes game. Hostess was outside with a security guard. I asked her how long the wait was and she snapped "I cannot quote you a wait time" and then turned her head away from me and didn't even bother to ask if I wanted to put my name on the wait list. First of all you always give the guest a estimate wait time and second of all don't be snappy about a simple question. Didn't end up going in because the hostess was the rudest girl I've ever encountered.
0	Just here on vacation with my family. Stopped by here because they're craving asian food. Ordered a burger and ate it half way through looking okay until it was literally raw beef. It wasn't rare. Just literally raw.   It was a struggle getting a refund after waiting awhile and the manager or whoever was managing that day didn't apologize. :/.  The girls were nice though, thanks.  Boba tea was awesome though.
1	Finally found the time to check this place out after hearing many good things about it.  Upon first glance, I wanted to get back in my car and speed away.  Interior is pretty basic and bare bone but the food!!!!!!  *JESUS*  Was amazing!  I love the amount of vegetables that came with the pho, great service, and a great price.  Might take the #1 spot on my pho spots in Charlotte list!
0	TERRIBLE!  Left me high and dry at Mesa Gateway airport late in the evening with promises that someone was on the way...never showed!  Not using this company again!
0	Meh is about right. This store is basically the same as the Smith's just up the street, only with higher prices and not as much selection. I come from California where everything is a ripoff ... and the prices here are just as bad if not worse. I don't remember it always being that way, but that's the way it is now.  Oh well. It's not like there aren't a ton of other grocery stores within a 90-second drive.
1	I love this place! Good products I can always find what I need. A little bit pricey on the guns but over all the warranties and the return policies are great. I've returned some binoculars that I dropped and no hassles. Make it easy to spend my money there. Like to see more kids clothes.
1	Love the desert heat wings. Lots of TV's for your sports viewing. The service is generally good the last couple times we have had to return the queso dip as it came to the table lukewarm. Each time the server was very apologetic.
1	If you are in Vegas and  you want to have great sushi in a fantastic hip spot, then head to the Hard Rock Hotel and go to Nobu's  Sure the Sushi is over priced and everyone is there to be seen, but that is what Vegas is all about. The Sushi is fantastic and consider the higher prices as a cost of entertainment.
1	Amazing sushi!  Only complaint was on one visit they brought my miso soup out after my rolls... it's typically a starter, so I'm thinking the waiter forgot about it.
0	I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill
0	Die Bewertung bezieht sich auf Terminal 1. das ist mit Abstand der schlechteste Terminal den ich je gesehen habe. Ekliger Teppich überall. Es gibt außer beim überteuerten Starbucks keine Möglichkeit etwas zu essen. Einen Food Court gibt es nicht. Es gibt zwei mager bestückte Zeitungsläden. Einfach nur ein Witz! Eine Bar zum betrinken gibts hier zwar doch die ist geschlossen...
1	Good restaurants, good shops and a great movie theater. I like coming here to catch the acoustic bands near the Barnes & Noble. The parking and traffic can be a nightmare on the weekends, so just be careful.
0	This place is lucky it is getting any stars.  I came here for my birthday and burger King would have been better. The managers could care less if the food is edible or not.  I told them and they did nothing for our party of 10 but basically say it was our fault for not telling them.  The menu is so limited now everything just sucks save your time and money go anywhere else literally.  This place should be burnt
0	Horrible customer service at this location, out of stock on a lot of items that are on sale.I will spend my money somewhere else.
0	My first time eating at a Five Guys, and I do not understand where all the rave is about. I was really disappointed with my burger. The service could not be worst! It took them 5 minutes to realized that my food had not been given to me. I was given the wrong order. I am very picky about my burger.  The staff is unfortunately clueless, and not highly motivated. They rather make jokes between them, the assist customers.
0	The waitress was overwhelmed. Other servers were not. Food took forever & was luke warm. I sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something Hot. Didn't really make a difference.
1	My wife & I tried out Sweet Tea's because of an Amazon Local Deal. Turned out to be a great little restaurant! Cozy atmosphere, and the staff was so nice. The good was great! We had the shrimp & grits, the Bang Bang shrimp, and the sweet potato fries (which they lightly salt and drizzle with honey). It all tasted great! Def going back!
0	Tried this place for lunch, had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend Matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime.
1	I have been a lifetime member for years now and I know what to expect from lifetime... that would be excellence in a gym.  The gym has everything you need, pool, fitness classes, plenty of machines and a weight area.  The location is clean and is located close to the freeway.  The only downfall to lifetime is the amount of members.  There are sometimes too many people there to feel comfortable when working out.
1	Sprouts is one of my favorite stores! I feel healthier just stepping in there. I love their selection of fish, meats, and of course the produce. The employees are very nice and always willing to help you out.  Sprouts is one of my go-to stores, along with Fresh-N-Easy!
